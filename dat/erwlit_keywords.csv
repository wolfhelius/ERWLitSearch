This article reviews evidence for the generation within the soil solution of dissolved C derived from plants and recognition of its precipitation as carbonates. It then considers the potential value of this process for artificially-mediated CO 2 sequestration within soils. The ability of crops such as wheat to produce organic acid anions as root exudates is substantial, generating 70 mol/(y kg) of exuded C, equivalent to the plant's own ‚Äòbody weight‚Äô. This is still an order of magnitude less than measured C production from Icelandic woodlands (Moulton et al. , 2000), which have no other possible source of C. Thus, there is apparently no shortage of available dissolved C, as bicarbonate in solution, and so the formation of pedogenic carbonates will be controlled by the availability of Ca. This is derived from mineral weathering, primarily of silicate minerals (natural plagioclase feldspars and pyroxenes; artificial cement and slag minerals). Within the UK, existing industrial arisings of calcium silicate minerals from quarrying, demolition and steel manufacture that are fine-grained and suitable for incorporation into soils are sufficient to account for 3 MT CO 2 per year, compensating for half of the emissions from UK cement manufacture.

We investigate the potential of a specific geoengineering technique, carbon sequestration by artificially enhanced silicate weathering via the dissolution of olivine. This approach would not only operate against rising temperatures but would also oppose ocean acidification, because it influences the global climate via the carbon cycle. If important details of the marine chemistry are taken into consideration, a new mass ratio of CO(2) sequestration per olivine dissolution of about 1 is achieved, 20% smaller than previously assumed. We calculate that this approach has the potential to sequestrate up to 1 Pg of C per year directly, if olivine is distributed as fine powder over land areas of the humid tropics, but this rate is limited by the saturation concentration of silicic acid. In our calculations for the Amazon and Congo river catchments, a maximum annual dissolution of 1.8 and 0.4 Pg of olivine seems possible, corresponding to the sequestration of 0.5 and 0.1 Pg of C per year, but these upper limit sequestration rates come at the environmental cost of pH values in the rivers rising to 8.2. Open water dissolution of fine-grained olivine and an enhancement of the biological pump by the rising riverine input of silicic acid might increase our estimate of the carbon sequestration, but additional research is needed here.

The carbon capture potential of enhanced weathering is large, yet there are few data on the effectiveness or engineering feasibility of such a scheme. Here, an energy/carbon balance is presented together with the associated operational costs for the United Kingdom as a case study. The silicate resources are large and could theoretically capture 430 billion tonnes (Gt) of CO2. The majority of this resource is contained in basic rocks (with a carbon capture potential of ‚àº0.3 tCO2 t‚àí1 rock). There are a limited number of ultrabasic formations (0.8 tCO2 t‚àí1 rock) with a total carbon capture potential of 25.4 GtCO2. It is shown that the energy costs of enhanced weathering may be 656‚Äì3501 kWh tCO2‚àí1 (net CO2 draw-down, which accounts for emissions during production) for basic rocks and 224‚Äì748 kWh tCO2‚àí1 for ultrabasic rocks.

When deployed on a grand scale, Enhanced Weathering (a form of mineral fertilization), the application of finely ground minerals over the land surface, could be used to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere. The release of cations during the dissolution of such silicate minerals would convert dissolved CO 2 to bicarbonate, increasing the alkalinity and pH of natural waters. Some products of mineral dissolution would precipitate in soils or be taken up by ecosystems, but a significant portion would be transported to the coastal zone and the open ocean, where the increase in alkalinity would partially counteract ‚Äúocean acidification‚Äù associated with the current marked increase in atmospheric CO 2 . Other elements released during this mineral dissolution, like Si, P, or K, could stimulate biological productivity, further helping to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere. On land, the terrestrial carbon pool would likely increase in response to Enhanced Weathering in areas where ecosystem growth rates are currently limited by one of the nutrients that would be released during mineral dissolution. In the ocean, the biological carbon pumps (which export organic matter and CaCO 3 to the deep ocean) may be altered by the resulting influx of nutrients and alkalinity to the ocean.

Dissolution rates determined from catchment scale investigations are generally several orders of magnitude slower than those predicted from kinetic information derived from laboratory studies. Here we present results from laboratory flow-through dissolution experiments which seek to bridge this observational discrepancy by using columns of soil returned to the laboratory from a field site. We constrain the dissolution rate of olivine added to the top of one of these columns, while maintaining much of the complexity inherent in the soil environment. Continual addition of water to the top of the soil columns, and analysis of elemental composition of waters exiting at the base was conducted for a period of five months, and the solid and leachable composition of the soils was also assessed before and after the experiments. Chemical results indicate clear release of Mg2+ from the dissolution of olivine and, by comparison with a control case, allow the rate of olivine dissolution to be estimated between 10‚àí16.4 and 10‚àí15.5 moles(Mg) cm‚àí2 s‚àí1. Measurements also allow secondary mineral formation in the soil to be assessed, and suggest that no significant secondary uptake of Mg2+ has occurred. The olivine dissolution rates are intermediate between those of pure laboratory and field studies and provide a useful constraint on weathering processes in natural environments, such as during soil profile deepening or the addition of mineral dust or volcanic ash to soils surfaces. The dissolution rates also provide critical information for the assessment of enhanced weathering including the expected surface-area and energy requirements.",doi,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2015.05.016,1,0,0,1,0,0,76,0,0,0,0,3,5,11,1,1

This is a consequence of rapid weathering of calcium silicate and hydroxide minerals derived from the demolition of concrete structures, which releases Ca that combines with CO2 ultimately derived from the atmosphere, precipitating as calcite. Stable isotope data confirm an atmospheric origin for carbonate carbon, and 14C dating indicates the predominance of modern carbon in the pedogenic calcite. Trial pits show that carbonation extends to depths of ‚â•1 m. Work at other sites shows that the occurrence of pedogenic carbonates is widespread in artificially created urban soils containing Ca and Mg silicate minerals. Appropriate management of fewer than 12000 ha of urban land to maximize calcite precipitation has the potential to remove 1 million t of CO2 from the atmosphere annually.

This promising technique uses cement and lime for construction purposes to enhance soil stability. However, binder production increases carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere per year. Therefore, sustainable materials for soil stabilization that are cost effective and not damaging to the surrounding soil upon treatment should be identified. Olivine [(Mg,Fe)2SiO4] is a sustainable material that can naturally capture CO2 in the atmosphere to form carbonated mineral. Furthermore, the chemical compositions of olivine are high amounts of magnesium oxide (MgO) and silicon oxide (SiO), as well as an adequate amount of silicon dioxide (SiO2), which make olivine a good candidate for soil stabilization in terms of hydration and pozzolanic reaction.This study aimed to address some issues about the use of olivine as a new sustainable material for soil stabilization through CO2 sequestration and in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), an alkaline activator. To identify the applicability of olivine-treated soil, the unconfined compressive strength (UCS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out on pure soil and olivine-treated soil before and after carbonation and in the presence of NaOH. The four specific objectives of this study are as follows. First is to investigate the mechanical and engineering behaviors of olivine-treated soil with different olivine contents at different curing times. Second is to determine the function of the carbonated olivine on the stability of soil at two different carbon pressures in different carbonation periods through the physical model in the laboratory.Third is to evaluate the effect of olivine in the presence of NaOH on soil stability and to identify the role of olivine as a source binder and NaOH as an activator of silicon and aluminum of olivine for soil stabilization at different curing times. Fourth and last is to examine the beneficial function of NaOH on the stability of carbonating olivine-treated soil at two different CO2 pressures with different carbonation periods based on geotechnical and microstructure analyses. In the first stage, mechanical and microstructure results confirmed that olivine changed the engineering properties of soil and increased soil stability up to 1.4 times more than untreated soil. In the second stage, the UCS of 20% olivine carbonated increased the strength of soil at high CO2 pressure after long carbonation period. The SEM analysis of 20% olivine-treated soil indicated that carbonated olivine decreased the soil discontinuity as a result of hydration and carbonation of MgO to produce Mg(OH)2 and MgCO3. The XRD analysis confirmed this indication. In the third stage, the results presented that the 20% olivine treated soil in the presence of 10 M NaOH increased the UCS of the soil after long curing time.Moreover, the SEM analysis confirmed the dissolution of olivine through the NaOH to have a homogenous soil structure. The EDX analysis demonstrated that when the Na/Al and Si/Al ratios increased, the soil strength also increased. The FTIR analysis showed the peaks of Si-O-Al, Si-O, Al-O, C-O, -OH, and H-O-H to establish the functions of NaOH and olivine as an activator and good source binder, respectively. In the final stage, carbonation of olivine-treated soil in the presence of NaOH at different pressures and different carbonation periods increased the strength of 20% olivine-treated soil to 6MPa. The following results were obtained: First, the use of 20% of olivine as a sustainable material for soil stabilization is noteworthy but it cannot sufficiently increase the strength of the soil. Second, the carbonation of olivine-treated soil increased the soil mechanical properties. Third, olivine acted as a source binder in the presence of NaOH to stabilize the soil. Finally, when the potential capacity of olivine carbonation in the presence of NaOH increased, the soil strength increased.

However, the implementation of NETs has varied energy, economic and environmental implications that need to be analysed in detail. In this paper, we explore the potential energy and economic costs for implementation of land-based NETs in Scotland. This analysis is based on the calculated averaged costs of the different technologies and the availability of resources for its implementation in Scotland. We found that the country has a maximum technical potential to abate 90‚Äì100% of its annual CO2 emissions by means of land-based NETs, thanks to its low annual emissions and large land area for implementation of NETs.

Biogeochemical improvement of soils by adding crushed, fast-reacting silicate rocks to croplands is one such CO2-removal strategy. This approach has the potential to improve crop production, increase protection from pests and diseases, and restore soil fertility and structure. Managed croplands worldwide are already equipped for frequent rock dust additions to soils, making rapid adoption at scale feasible, and the potential benefits could generate financial incentives for widespread adoption in the agricultural sector. However, there are still obstacles to be surmounted. Audited field-scale assessments of the efficacy of CO2 capture are urgently required together with detailed environmental monitoring. A cost-effective way to meet the rock requirements for CO2 removal must be found, possibly involving the recycling of silicate waste materials. Finally, issues of public perception, trust and acceptance must also be addressed. To reduce climate warming we must stop adding CO2 to the atmopshere, and develop approaches for removing it.

However, dissolution rates of silicate minerals in the soil environment are uncertain and impacts of their application on the decomposition of soil organic matter have yet to be determined. A 3-month soil incubation was performed to investigate the effects of olivine, a highly weatherable silicate mineral, at two application rates (OLIVlow, OLIVhigh) on soil CO2 flux, available Mg and Al, and pH in comparison to control and lime-amended soils. There was no difference in cumulative net CO2 flux between the olivine-amended soils and the control though total flux from the limed soils was 221% higher than the control. Heterotrophic respiration was also greatest in the lime-amended soils. The weathering rate of OLIVlow (26.7%) was higher than of OLIVhigh (7.1%), but both treatments increased soil pH to a level sufficient to overcome aluminum toxicity.

Due to the relative simplicity of its dissolution mechanism, most of these studies provide mutually consistent results such that a comparison of their rates can provide insight into the reactivity of silicate minerals as a whole. Olivine dissolution is controlled by the breaking of octahedral M2+-oxygen bonds at or near the surface, liberating adjoining SiO44‚àí tetrahedra to the aqueous fluid. Aqueous species that adsorb to these bonds apparently accelerate their destruction. For example, the absorption of H+, H2O and, at some conditions, selected aqueous organic species will increase olivine dissolution rates. Nevertheless, other factors can slow olivine dissolution rates. Notably, olivine dissolution rates are slowed by lowering the surface area exposed to the reactive aqueous fluid, by for example the presence and/or growth on these surfaces of either microbes or secondary phases. The degree to which secondary phases decelerate rates depends on their ability to limit access of the reactive aqueous fluids to the olivine surface. It seems likely that these surface area limiting processes are very significant in natural systems, lowering olivine surface reactivity in many environments compared to rates measured on cleaned surfaces in the laboratory. A survey of the literature suggests that the major factors influencing forsteritic olivine dissolution rates are 1) pH, 2) water activity, 3) temperature, and 4) mineral-fluid interfacial surface area. Evidence suggests that the effects of aqueous inorganic and organic species are relatively limited, and may be attributed at least in part to their influence on aqueous solution pH. Moreover, the observed decrease in rates due to the presence of secondary mineral coatings and/or the presence of microbes can be attributed to their ability to decrease olivine surface area directly exposed to the reactive aqueous fluid. As the reactivity of forsterite surfaces are spatially heterogeneous, its surface area normalized rates will tend to decrease as it dissolves even in the absence of a mineral or bacterial coating. Each of these factors limits and or influences the application of forsterite dissolution to 1) enhanced weathering efforts, 2) mineral carbonation, and 3) the low temperature generation of hydrogen or hydrocarbons via the oxidation of its divalent iron.",doi,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2018.10.008,0,0,0,0,0,4,222,3,6,2,9,4,1,0,1,1

Continental silicate weathering constitutes a stable carbon sink that is an important influence on long-term climate change, as it sequesters atmospheric carbon dioxide at a million-year time scale. Traditionally, CO2 sequestered through silicate weathering is estimated by measuring the flux of the base cations to watersheds. However, plants also absorb considerable amounts of base cations. Plant biomass is often removed from ecosystems during harvesting. The base cations are subsequently released after decomposition of the harvested plant materials, and thereby enhance CO2 consumption related to weathering. Here, we analyze plant biomass storage-harvest fluxes (production and removal of biomass from forests) of base cations in forests across China to quantify the relative contribution of forest trees to the terrestrial weathering-related carbon sink. Our data suggest that the potential CO2 consumption rate for biomass-related silicate weathering (from the combined action of with afforestation/reforestation, controlled harvesting and rock powder amendment) in Chinese forests is 7.9¬±4.1Tg CO2yr-1. This represents ~34% of the chemical weathering rate in China.

We provide the first comprehensive assessment of economic costs, energy requirements, technical parameterization, and global and regional carbon removal potential. The crucial parameters defining this potential are the grain size and weathering rates. The main uncertainties about the potential relate to weathering rates and rock mass that can be integrated into the soil. The discussed results do not specifically address the enhancement of weathering through microbial processes, feedback of geogenic nutrient release, and bioturbation. We do not only assess dunite rock, predominantly bearing olivine (in the form of forsterite) as the mineral that has been previously proposed to be best suited for carbon removal, but focus also on basaltic rock to minimize potential negative side effects. Our results show that enhanced weathering is an option for carbon dioxide removal that could be competitive already at 60 US $ t‚àí1 CO2 removed for dunite, but only at 200 US $ t‚àí1 CO2 removed for basalt.

The idea of agrominerals has been around since the early 19th century. However, widespread application is subject to economic practicality. In recent years, two big trends have dominated agromineral research. First, some global warming mitigation strategies, such as ‚Äòenhanced chemical weathering‚Äô and bio-energy carbon capture and storage call for the application of rock powders in arable land on a massive scale. This gives agromineral research an urgency and significance. Second, advances in knowledge of mineral weathering kinetics are poised to transform predictions of agronomic effectiveness from mere empirical studies to more quantitative evaluation. We now have a much better understanding of the factors that influence weathering and nutrient release rates. We forecast that rapid advances in some areas of biogeochemistry will enable advances in the study of agrominerals.

Rapid greenhouse gas emissions over the past few decades already commit Earth to a warmer climate state and lock‚Äêin future extinctions. I consider what steps might be taken to protect the climate and the future of the biosphere by drawing on our understanding of the Devonian rise of forests. At stake is nothing less than the future of humanity and the fate of species we are fortunate enough to share the planet with. Summary Drastic phase down of our carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from burning fossil fuels within decades will likely be insufficient to avoid seeding catastrophic human‚Äêcaused climate change. We have to also start removing CO 2 from the atmosphere, safely, affordably and within decades. Technological approaches for large‚Äêscale carbon removal and storage hold great promise but are far from the gigaton‚Äêscale required. Enhanced chemical weathering of crushed silicate rocks and afforestation are proposed CO 2 removal approaches mimicking events during the Devonian rise of forests that triggered massive CO 2 drawdown and the great late Palaeozoic cooling.

This demonstrates that using wollastonite as a soil amendment, along with legume cultivation, not only buffers the soil against acidification (due to microbial nitrogen fixation) but also sequesters carbon dioxide (12.04 kg of CO2/tonne soil/month, 9 times higher than the soil without wollastonite amendment).",doi,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.68,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.05,0.84,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.99,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.8b02477,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,108,1,1,1,1

In this context, the carbon dioxide sequestration technology of enhanced weathering has for years been investigated, with a possible implementation strategy via alkaline mineral soil amendment being more recently proposed. Candidate materials for enhanced weathering include calcium and magnesium silicates, most notably those belonging to the olivine, pyroxene and serpentine groups of minerals, given their reactivity with CO2 and global availability. When these finely crushed silicate rocks are applied to the soil, the alkaline earth metal cations released during mineral weathering gradually react with carbonate anions and results in the formation of pedogenic carbonates, which, over time, and under the right conditions, can accumulate in the soil. This review paper critically reviews the available literature on alkaline mineral soil amendments and its potential to sequester enough CO2 to be considered a climate change ‚Äòstabilization wedge‚Äô. Firstly, evidence of how agricultural soil can serve as a carbon sink in discussed, based on the observed accumulation of inorganic carbon in alkaline mineral-amended soils. Secondly, the impact of alkaline minerals on agricultural soil and crops, and the factors determining the rate of the weathering process are assessed. Lastly, the CO2 sequestration potential via alkaline mineral soil amendment is quantified according to an idealized shrinking core model, which shows that it has the potential to serve as a climate change stabilization wedge.",doi,tech|04,meth|02,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.3390/en12122299,2,0,0,2,0,3,38,0,9,0,11,22,18,4,1,1

Through a Life Cycle Assessment, we determine the balance of carbon dioxide emissions involved in the use of this material, the relative contribution of soil carbonation and enhanced weathering, and the potential carbon dioxide removal of Sao Paulo agricultural land through enhanced weathering of basalt rock. Our results show that enhanced weathering and carbonation respectively emit around 75 and 135 kg carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent removed (considering a quarry to field distance of 65 km). We underline transportation as the principal process negatively affecting the practice and uncover a limiting road travel distance from the quarry to the field of 540 ¬± 65 km for carbonation and 990 ¬± 116 km for enhanced weathering, above which the emissions offset the potential capture.

It was proposed to enhance this process to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere. While there are some studies that propose and theoretically analyze the application of rock powder to agricultural land, results from field experiments are still scarce. In order to evaluate the efficiency and side effects of Enhanced Weathering (EW), a mesocosm experiment was set up and agricultural soil from Belgium was amended with olivine-bearing dunite ground to two different grain sizes, while distinguishing setups with and without crops. Based on measurements of Mg, Si, pH, and DIC, the additional weathering effect of olivine could be confirmed. Calculated weathering rates are up to 3 orders of magnitude lower than found in other studies. The calculated CO2 consumption by weathering based on the outlet water of the mesocosm systems was low with 2.3‚Äì4.9 tCO2km-2a-1 if compared with previous theoretical estimates. Suspected causes were the removal or dilution of Mg as a weathering product by processes like adsorption, mineralization, plant uptake, evapotranspiration, and/or preferential flow, not specifically addressed in previous EW experiments for CO2 consumption. The observation that Mg concentrations in the upper soil layers were about 1 order of magnitude higher than in the outlet water indicates that a careful tracking of weathering indicators like Mg in the field is essential for a precise estimate of the CO2 consumption potential of EW, specifically under global deployment scenarios with a high diversity of ecosystem settings. Porewater Mg‚àïSi molar ratios suggest that dissolved Si is reprecipitating, forming a cation-depleted Si layer on the reactive mineral surface of freshly ground rocks. The release of potentially harmful trace elements is an acknowledged side effect of EW. Primarily Ni and Cr are elevated in the soil solution, while Ni concentrations exceed the limits of drinking water quality. The use of olivine, rich in Ni and Cr, is not recommended, and alternative rock sources are suggested for the application.",doi,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.04,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.1,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.9,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.96,0.05,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-103-2020,0,0,4,2,3,19,62,0,3,0,11,0,24,23,1,1

Urea, calcium and simple carbon nutrients are supplied to produce carbonates via urea hydrolysis and induce the precipitation of the mineral calcite. Calcium chloride (CaCl2) is typically used as a source for calcium, but silicate rocks and other materials have been investigated as alternatives. Weathering of calcium-rich silicate rocks (e.g. basalt and dolerite) releases calcium, magnesium and iron; this process is associated with sequestration of atmospheric CO2 and formation of pedogenic carbonates. We investigated atmospheric carbon fluxes of a MICP treated sandy soil using CaCl2 and dolerite fines applied on the soil surface as sources for calcium. Soil-atmosphere carbon fluxes were monitored over two months and determined with an infrared gas analyser connected to a soil chamber. Soil inorganic carbon content and isotopic composition were determined with isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. In addition, soil-atmosphere CO2 fluxes during chemical weathering of dolerite fines were investigated in incubation experiments with gas chromatography. Larger CO2 emissions resulted from the application of dolerite fines (116 g CO2-C m-2) compared to CaCl2 (79 g CO2-C m-2) but larger inorganic carbon precipitation also occurred (172.8 g C m-2 and 76.9 g C m-2, respectively). Normalising to the emitted carbon to precipitated carbon, the environmental carbon cost was reduced with dolerite fines (0.67) compared to the traditional MICP treatment (1.01). The carbon isotopic signature indicated pedogenic carbonates (Œ¥13Cav = 8.2¬±5.0‚Ä∞) formed when dolerite was applied and carbon originating from urea (Œ¥13Cav = 46.4¬±1.0‚Ä∞) precipitated when CaCl2 was used.

The weathering of these silicate minerals is also associated with the release of heavy metals such as Ni and Cr, depending on the composition of the parent rock, and also labile Si. This paper critically analyses the risk associated with the release of Ni, Cr, and Si from alkaline silicate minerals as a result of enhanced weathering to evaluate its potential to be applied as a soil amendment. Based on the available data in the literature, this study evaluates the soil contamination level and quantifies the risk these elements pose to human health as well as the environment. To assess these potential threat levels, the geoaccumulation index was applied, along with the method recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency for health risk assessment. The main findings of this study indicate the potential release of Ni, Cr, and Si to exceed the soil quality guideline value.

Soils offer a large natural sink to store CO2. This study focuses on sequestering CO2 in the agricultural soils as inorganic carbon, which can be accomplished by adding alkaline-earth silicates. Wollastonite is used in this study as a soil amendment, to sequester CO2via the geochemical route of mineral carbonation. The first objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of mixing a wide range of dosages of wollastonite, as a soil amendment, on the growth performance of two leguminous plants frequently used in agricultural sector: soybean and alfalfa. The plants were grown with different wollastonite dosages (3-20 kg¬∑m-2 for soybean and 3-40 kg¬∑m-2 for alfalfa), for a duration of 14 weeks in a microplot experiment in Ontario, Canada. The second objective was to find evidence of enhanced weathering of wollastonite in soil, in addition to the augmentation of inorganic carbon content in soil. For this, mineralogical assessment of the soils was performed using XRD and SEM-EDS analyses. Wollastonite increased the soybean yield by two-fold in the plot amended with 10 kg¬∑m-2. At all dosages, wollastonite increased the alfalfa growth in terms of height and above-ground biomass dry weight, as well as root biomass. The rate of CO2 sequestration, at optimum wollastonite dosage, reached 0.08 kg CO2¬∑m-2¬∑month-1. XRD and SEM-EDS analyses indicated accumulation of calcite in wollastonite-amended soil and formation of other weathering products. The results obtained from this study help to understand the impact of wollastonite soil amendment on agronomy, and will aid in implementing such negative emissions technology by informing farmers and industry alike that the use of wollastonite contributes toward global climate change mitigation while supporting crop yield. The findings of this study add to the existing body of knowledge on enhanced weathering as an atmospheric CO2 removal technology, providing further evidence that wollastonite weathering in agricultural soils can lead to significant capacity for CO2 sequestration as inorganic carbon, while concurrently promoting plant growth.",doi,tech|04,meth|00,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.84,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.07,0.77,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.9,0.2,0.01,0.03,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.01012,1,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,4,169,0,0,1,1

When applied to soils, at suitable geochemical conditions, alkaline minerals lead to accumulation of soil inorganic carbon as pedogenic carbonates. Agricultural land covers 37 % of the Earth‚Äôs land surface, thus offering a natural sink for atmospheric CO2. Wollastonite (CaSiO3) has been commercialized in Ontario as an agricultural soil amendment for several years, but it is not known if or how much CO2 is sequestered annually. In the present study, wollastonite-amended soils were collected from three commercial-scale fields located in Ontario: a leafy vegetables farm in the town of Paris (Field 1); a potato farm in the settlement of Alliston (Field 2); and a soybean farm in the city of Woodstock (Field 3). Chemical and mineralogical assessments of these soils were conducted to determine their carbonate content and the fate of the wollastonite. The soil inorganic carbon (SIC) content was higher in all soils that had been amended with wollastonite, compared to controls, and in Field 1 the SIC content was 2.6 times higher in soil amended thrice with wollastonite compared to a single application. Mineralogical analysis showed the presence of additional polymorphs of SiO2, which may originate from the wollastonite after the dissolution of calcium.

However, the efficacy of the approach when undertaken with basalt, and its potential co‚Äêbenefits for agriculture, require experimental and field evaluation. Here we report that amending a UK clay‚Äêloam agricultural soil with a high loading (10 kg/m 2 ) of relatively coarse‚Äêgrained crushed basalt significantly increased the yield (21 ¬± 9.4%, SE ) of the important C 4 cereal Sorghum bicolor under controlled environmental conditions, without accumulation of potentially toxic trace elements in the seeds. Yield increases resulted from the basalt treatment after 120 days without P‚Äê and K‚Äêfertilizer addition. Shoot silicon concentrations also increased significantly (26 ¬± 5.4%, SE ), with potential benefits for crop resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. Elemental budgets indicate substantial release of base cations important for inorganic carbon removal and their accumulation mainly in the soil exchangeable pools.

Goll,Impacts of Enhanced Weathering on biomass production for negative emission technologies and soil hydrology,,"Limiting global mean temperature changes to well below 2 ¬∞C likely requires a rapid and large-scale deployment of Negative Emission Technologies (NETs). Assessments so far showed a high potential for biomass based terrestrial NETs, but only few included effects of the commonly found nutrient deficient soils on biomass production. Here, we investigate the deployment of Enhanced Weathering (EW) to supply nutrients to phosphorus (P) deficient areas of Afforestation/Reforestation and naturally growing forests (AR) and bio-energy grasses (BG), besides the impacts on soil hydrology. Using stoichiometric ratios and biomass estimates from two established vegetation models, we calculated the nutrient demand of AR and BG. By comparing the inferred AR P demand to different geogenic P supply scenarios, we estimated that 3‚Äì98 Gt C of the predicted biomass accumulation cannot be realized due to insufficient soil P supply for an AR scenario considering natural N supply. An amount of 2‚Äì362 Gt basalt powder applied by EW would be needed to cover P gaps and completely sequester projected amounts of 190 Gt C during years 2006‚Äì2099. The potential carbon sequestration by EW is 0.6‚Äì97.8 Gt CO2 for the same scenario. For BG, 8 kg basalt m‚àí2 a‚àí1 might, on average, replenish the exported K and P by harvest. Using pedotransfer functions, we show that the impacts of basalt powder application on soil hydraulic conductivity and plant available water, for closing predicted P gaps, would depend on basalt and soil texture, but in general the impacts are marginal. We show that EW could potentially close the projected P gaps of an AR scenario, and exported nutrients by BG harvest, which would decrease or replace the use of industrial fertilizers. Besides that, EW ameliorates soil capacity to retain nutrients, soil pH, and renew soil nutrient pools. Last, EW applications could improve plant available water capacity depending on deployed amounts of rock powder ‚Äì adding a new dimension to the coupling of land-based biomass NETs with EW.",title,tech|05,meth|02,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-386,0,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,0,0,107,0,1,0,1,1

We used 3 years of field observations from maize ( Zea mays ) and miscanthus ( Miscanthus √ó giganteus ) to improve the nitrogen (N) module of the DayCent model and evaluate the potential of basalt amendments to reduce N losses and increase yields from two bioenergy crops. We found 20%‚Äì60% improvement in our N 2 O flux estimates over previous model descriptions. Model results predict that the application of basalt would reduce N 2 O emissions by 16% in maize and 9% in miscanthus. Lower N 2 O emissions responded to increases in the N 2 :N 2 O ratio of denitrification with basalt‚Äêinduced increases in soil pH, with minor contributions from the impact of P additions (a minor component of some basalts) on N immobilization. The larger reduction of N 2 O emissions in maize than in miscanthus was likely explained by a synergistic effect between soil pH and N content, leading to a higher sensitivity of the N 2 :N 2 O ratio to changes in pH in heavily fertilized maize. Basalt amendments led to modest increases in modeled yields and the nitrogen use efficiency (i.e., fertilizer‚ÄêN recover in crop production) of maize but did not affect the productivity of miscanthus. However, enhanced soil P availability maintained the long‚Äêterm productivity of crops with high nutrient requirements. The alleviation of plant P limitation led to enhanced plant N uptake, thereby contributing to lower microbial N availability and N 2 O emissions from crops with high nutrient requirements. Our results from the improved model suggest that the large‚Äêscale deployment of basalt, by reducing N 2 O fluxes of cropping systems, could contribute to the sustainable intensification of agriculture and enhance the climate mitigation potential of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage strategies.",doi,tech|10,meth|02,cont|5,0.12,0.48,0.02,0.14,0.06,0.04,0.02,0.01,0.04,0.04,0.74,0.03,0.0,0.03,0.02,0.07,0.02,0.07,0.05,0.98,0.03,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.99,yes,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.12757,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,106,0,0,0,1,1

Afforestation and bioenergy coupled with carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage are the main land negative emission technologies proposed, but the range of nature-based solutions is wider. Here we explore soil amendment with powdered basalt in natural ecosystems. Basalt is an abundant rock resource, which reacts with CO2 and removes it from the atmosphere. Besides, basalt improves soil fertility and thereby potentially enhances ecosystem carbon storage, rendering a global CO2 removal of basalt substantially larger than previously suggested. As this is a fully developed technology that can be co-deployed in existing land systems, it is suited for rapid upscaling. Achieving sufficiently high net CO2 removal will require upscaling of basalt mining, deploying systems in remote areas with a low carbon footprint and using energy from low-carbon sources. We argue that basalt soil amendment should be considered a prominent option when assessing land management options for mitigating climate change, but yet unknown side-effects, as well as limited data on field-scale deployment, need to be addressed first. The enhanced CO2 uptake by vegetation in response to powdered rock should be considered in assessing the feasibility of enhanced weathering as a negative emission technology in mitigating climate change, suggest simulations of a land surface model.",doi,tech|10,meth|02,cont|5,0.07,0.08,0.04,0.11,0.14,0.16,0.04,0.02,0.06,0.01,0.93,0.05,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.14,0.02,0.01,0.04,0.94,0.02,0.01,0.15,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03,0.97,yes,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-021-00798-x,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,51,0,0,0,1,1

However, recent trends indicate that human activities have switched their net cooling effect to a warming effect due to management intensification and land conversion. This indicates an urgent need for strategies directed to mitigate climate warming while enhancing productivity and efficiency in the use of land and natural (nutrients, water) resources. Here, we examine the potential of four innovative strategies to slow climate change including: 1) Adaptive multi-paddock grazing that consists of mimicking how ancestral herds roamed the Earth; 2) Agrivoltaics that consists of simultaneously producing food and energy from solar panels on the same land area; 3) Agroforestry with a reverse phenology tree species, Faidherbia (Acacia) albida, that has the unique trait of being photosynthetically active when intercropped herbaceous plants are dormant; and, 4) Enhanced Weathering, a negative emission technology that removes atmospheric CO2 from the atmosphere. Further, we speculate about potential unknown consequences of these different management strategies and identify gaps in knowledge. We find that all these strategies could promote at least some of the following benefits of grasslands: CO2 sequestration, non-CO2 GHG mitigation, productivity, resilience to climate change, and an efficient use of natural resources. However, there are obstacles to be overcome. Mechanistic assessment of the ecological, environmental, and socio-economic consequences of adopting these strategies at large scale are urgently needed to fully assess the potential of grasslands to provide food, energy and environmental security.",doi,tech|07,meth|05,cont|4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149466,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,18,0,0,0,1,1

Here, we report a detailed characterization of the mineralogy, chemistry, particle size and surface area of six mined basalts being used in large-scale ERW field trials. We use 1-D reactive transport modelling (RTM) of soil profile processes to simulate inorganic CDR potential via cation flux (Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , K + and Na + ) and assess the release of the essential plant nutrients phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) for a typical clay-loam agricultural soil. The basalts are primarily composed of pyroxene and plagioclase feldspar (up to 71 wt%), with accessory olivine, quartz, glass and alkali feldspar. Mean crushed particle size varies by a factor of 10, owing to differences in the mining operations and grinding processes. RTM simulations, based on measured mineral composition and N 2 -gas BET specific surface area (SSA), yielded potential CDR values of between c. 1.3 and 8.5 t CO 2 ha ‚àí1 after 15 years following a baseline application of 50 t ha ‚àí1 basalt. The RTM results are comparative for the range of inputs that are described and should be considered illustrative for an agricultural soil. Nevertheless, they indicate that increasing the surface area for slow-weathering basalts through energy intensive grinding prior to field application in an ERW context may not be warranted in terms of additional CDR gains. We developed a function to convert CDR based on widely available and easily measured rock chemistry measures to more realistic determinations based on mineralogy. When applied to a chemistry dataset for >1300 basalt analyses from 25 large igneous provinces, we simulated cumulative CDR potentials of up to c. 8.5 t CO 2 ha ‚àí1 after 30 years of weathering, assuming a single application of basalt with a SSA of 1 m 2 g ‚àí1 .

In countries with active volcanoes, such as Indonesia, volcanic ash could be used to supply nutrients and reduce CO2 from the atmosphere. The weathering can draw CO2 from the atmosphere; in addition, volcanic ash with 0% carbon can turn into soils with around 10% organic carbon. In Indonesia, soils of volcanic origin cover about 31.7 million ha or 17% of its land area. Frequent volcanic eruptions made volcanic ash or tephra readily available. However, tephra is not widely used and has not been adequately investigated as a soil amendment to sequester carbon. This paper calculates the magnitude and opportunity of CO2 drawdown potential from volcanic materials produced annually in Indonesia. In years with significant volcanic eruptions, the subsequent withdrawal will be 100‚Äì200 Mt CO2 or 20‚Äì40% of the country's fossil fuel emission. The CO2 captured when volcanic materials weather is part of the global carbon cycle and is influenced by land-use decisions. Currently, volcanic ash is often eroded and rapidly transferred to aquatic systems. In relevant landscapes, actively managing this untapped resource is more feasible than external basalt applications as volcanic ashes do not need to be ground, can soak up significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, and build fertile soils that supply an abundance of nutrients to achieve food and soil security.

However, only a small reactive fraction of these feedstocks will be accessible for carbon dioxide removal at Earth's surface conditions. We have developed a new method to evaluate the reactivity of mineral feedstocks that consists of a batch leach test using CO2 coupled with total inorganic carbon (TIC) analysis to quantify easily extractable Mg and Ca from non-carbonate (desirable) cation sources. Kimberlite residues from the Venetia Diamond Mine (South Africa), serpentinites, wollastonite skarn, and brucite ore were tested and the results were compared to those from commercial ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) leach tests. A strong correlation (R2 = 0.99) between leached Ca and TIC showed that carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite in kimberlite) are a substantial and undesirable source of easily extractable cations that must be excluded in calculating CO2 sequestration potential. Silicate dissolution (e.g., serpentine) was inferred from the strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.94) between Mg and Si concentrations leached from kimberlites and serpentinites. Strong correlations between leached Ca and Si were only detected for wollastonite skarns, whereas Mg leaching from samples with high abundances of brucite showed weak or no relationship to TIC or Si. The ability to distinguish between sources (non-carbonate versus carbonate) of easily extractable cations is necessary to accurately assess CO2 sequestration potential. The maximum CO2 storage capacity of the Venetia kimberlites was 268‚Äì342 kg CO2/t, and our leach test estimated an accessible potential in the range of 3‚Äì9 kg CO2/t when only accounting for non-carbonate sources.

The experimental design mimics olivine addition to soils for CO2 sequestration and/or crop fertilisation, as well as natural surface addition of reactive minerals such as during volcanic deposition. More generally, this study presents an opportunity to better understand how isotopic fractionation records weathering processes. At the start of the experiment, waters draining both cores have similar Mg isotope composition to the soil exchangeable pool. The composition in the two cores evolve in different directions as olivine dissolution progresses. Mass balance calculations show that the water Œ¥26Mg value is controlled by congruent dissolution of carbonate and silicates (the latter in the olivine core only), plus an isotopically fractionated exchangeable pool. For Li, waters exiting the base of the cores initially have the same isotope composition, but then diverge as olivine dissolution progresses. For both Mg and Li, the transport down-core is significantly retarded and fractionated by exchange with the exchangeable pool.

It has been shown that enhanced weathering is principally feasible on a global scale, but there is still uncertainty with respect to the predicted drawdown in a given timeframe. This information is however vital to evaluate, if enhanced weathering should be further considered as a factor to alleviate the impact of the climate crisis. With this in mind, this article reviews of the current state of research and estimates the CO2 drawdown for scenarios using basalt powders of different particle size distribution (<100 Œºm, <10 Œºm and <1 Œºm). Calculated with a modified shrinking core model, the amount of powder dissolved within a timeframe of 10 years is approximately 16% (<100 Œºm), 55% (<10 Œºm) and 99.9% (<1 Œºm). This corresponds to a gross CO2 removal of 0.045 t CO2 t‚àí1 of rock (<100 Œºm) and 0.153 t CO2 t‚àí1 of rock, (<10 Œºm). We evaluate our results on regional scale through a case study for Austria, including emissions from mining, comminution, application and transport. Assuming an average distance of 300 km from mine to field, the net CO2 drawdown decreases to approximately 0.027 t CO2 t‚àí1 of rock (<100 Œºm) or 0.096 t CO2 t‚àí1 (<10 Œºm), when rail transport is used. For truck transport, the numbers are reduced to ‚àí0.030 t CO2 t‚àí1 of rock (<100 Œºm) or 0.039 t CO2 t‚àí1 (<10 Œºm), respectively. Accordingly, at the current CO2 intensity, transport related emissions may cancel out any drawdown if grain sizes (<100 Œºm) are used. Our estimates suggest that enhanced weathering will only significantly contribute to net CO2 drawdown if grain sizes (<10 Œºm) are used. Under these conditions the large-scale application of particles with a diameter <10 Œºm may remove about 2% of Austria's annual Greenhouse gas emissions. We discuss challenges towards this goal, including the enormous amounts of rock needed and the energy requirement related to grinding, as well as uncertainties related to actual field weathering rates. Those uncertainties hinder the precise quantification of CO2 drawdown as of now. While enhanced weathering remains a promising path for climate change mitigation, further research at laboratory and field scale is required to put this technology to optimal use.",doi,tech|10,meth|02,cont|5,0.05,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.04,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.88,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.95,0.05,0.01,0.09,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128178,8,0,2,5,1,4,17,19,1,16,77,4,1,1,1,1

One measure that can contribute to reducing atmospheric CO 2 is ""enhanced weathering"" through application of ground silicates. Here we propose that mycorrhizal fungi may critically contribute to the success of enhanced weathering in agricultural systems. Fundamental lab‚Äêbased experiments now need to go hand in hand with real‚Äêworld field trials, with the goal to optimize both decarbonization and environmental sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. Summary Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have significantly contributed to weathering of the earth's surface since their evolutionary origin 400‚Äì500 million years ago. They have been a key player in the global carbon cycle over geological timescales. In order to reach the global warming targets as agreed at the Paris summit in 2015, implementation of negative emission technologies is necessary. Among the options, one of the simplest is ""enhanced weathering"", where silicate rock is ground into small particles to enhance weathering rate. Here we synthesize the ways by which mycorrhizal fungi interact with these particles when applied to agricultural fields, and suggest they may stimulate weathering by various direct and indirect mechanisms. We conclude that because the intensity with which mycorrhiza interact with soil is tightly related to plant provisioning of photosynthates in exchange for soil‚Äêderived nutrients, weathering rates and hence carbon sequestration are likely to increase with agricultural activities that stimulate plant reliance on and investment in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.",doi,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.10179,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,9,1,0,0,1,1

Alkalinity is a measure to track weathering products. It is not difficult to measure, yet continuous and mid- to high-frequency sampling and analyses are expensive and time consuming. The observed strong correlation of alkalinity with electrical conductivity could be harnessed and enable a CO 2 uptake monitoring by simple electrical conductivity measurements in soils or any point in the discharge system.

To elucidate the effects of grain size distribution and soil partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( p CO 2 ) levels on CO 2 uptake rates, two simple column experiments were designed and filled nearly daily with an amount of water that simulates humid tropical conditions, which prevail in areas known for being hotspots of weathering. Multiple materials (dunite, basanite, agricultural oxisol, a combination of the latter two, and loess) were compared under ambient and 100% CO 2 atmosphere. In a second series, single material columns (dunite) were filled with three different grain size distributions. Total alkalinity, pH, major ions, and dissolved silica were determined in the outflow water of the columns for about 300 days. Under ambient atmospheric conditions, the CO 2 consumption was the lowest in the oxisol column, with 100 t CO 2 km ‚àí2 year ‚àí1 , while dunite and basanite showed similar consumption rates (around 220 t CO 2 km ‚àí2 year ‚àí1 ). The values are comparable to high literature values for ultramafic lithologies. Interestingly, the mixture of basanite and oxisol has a much higher consumption rate (around 430 t CO 2 km ‚àí2 year ‚àí1 ) than the basanite alone. The weathering fluxes under saturated CO 2 conditions are about four times higher in all columns, except the dunite column, where fluxes are increased by a factor of more than eleven. Grain size distribution differences also play a role, with the highest grain surface area normalized weathering rates observed in the columns with coarser grains, which at first seems counterintuitive. Our findings point to some important issues to be considered in future experiments and a potential rollout of EW as a carbon dioxide removal method. Only in theory do small grain sizes of the spread-material yield higher CO 2 drawdown potentials than coarser material. The hydrologic conditions, which determine the residence times in the pore space, i.e., the time available for weathering reactions, can be more important than small grain size.

Laboratory studies have attempted to evaluate the potential of enhanced weathering as a CO2 removal technique but do not simulate the geochemical complexity of soil environments, and studies in the field are limited in the nature of data they can collect. To overcome these limitations, this study uses an experimental set-up which fully encapsulates field conditions in a controlled setting using soil cores removed from UK cropland and treated with crushed basalt. Cores were exposed to natural weather conditions throughout a 14-month time series, and soil solution was sampled in 10‚Äì20 cm intervals in the core to provide insight into the fate of dissolution products with soil depth. This study assessed the rate and chemistry of basalt dissolution 8 months after addition at a high application rate (100 t basalt ha‚àí1) using direct measurements from a UK soil. Assuming conclusions drawn from this study are representative of field-scale enhanced weathering, findings indicate that a set application of basalt to lime-rich, unirrigated UK soils releases alkalinity at a rate of 310 ¬± 30 eq ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1 and could remove 10.2 ¬± 0.8 kgCO2 ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1. Accumulation of undissolved basalt may also lead to large and irreversible changes to soil compositions following repeated application. When considering variation in hydrology around the UK, we assess the drawdown potential of application of basalt to all UK arable land as 1.3 ¬± 0.1 MtCO2 yr‚àí1 which is equivalent to 3% of current UK agricultural CO2 emissions. This is 5- to 25- fold slower than previous modelled assessments, likely due to complexities of soil systems and to water limitation on alkalinity release. Further research is needed to fully assess controls on the potential of enhanced weathering in the real-world environment, across a range of hydrological and soil environments, before the approach is substantively scaled-up for CO2 removal.",doi,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.25,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.91,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.95,0.09,0.01,0.03,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105482,3,1,0,0,0,0,18,1,0,0,120,0,3,5,1,1

EW relies on the accelerated dissolution of crushed silicate rocks applied to soils and is considered a sustainable solution requiring limited technology. While EW has a high theoretical potential of sequestering CO2, research is still needed to provide accurate estimates of carbon (C) sequestration when applying different silicate materials across distinct climates and major soil types in combination with a variety of plants.

In this context, models play a pivotal role, as they allow exploring and predicting EW dynamics under different environmental conditions. Here a comprehensive hydro-biogeochemical model has been applied to four cropland case studies (i.e., Sicily and the Padan plain in Italy and California and Iowa in the USA) characterized by different rainfall seasonality, vegetation (i.e., wheat for Sicily and California and corn for the Padan plain and Iowa), and soil type to explore their influence on dissolution rates. The results reveal that rainfall seasonality and irrigation when applied are crucial in determining EW and carbon sequestration dynamics, given their effect on hydrological fluxes, soil pH and weathering rate. The carbon sequestration rate was found to be strongly affected also by the background weathering flux, which is one of the main factors controlling soil pH before the olivine amendment. Regarding the US case studies, Iowa sequesters the greatest amount of CO2 if compared to California (4.20 and 2.21 kg ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1, respectively), and the same happens for Sicily with respect to the Padan plain (0.62 and 0.39 kg ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1, respectively).

This technique has also been shown to deliver fruitful results in terms of improving soil health, and in turn plant health, through remineralization. The silicate minerals that possess the highest weathering rates (e.g., wollastonite), are relatively rare in nature, whereas the abundant ones (e.g., anorthite and forsterite) have a slower pace of weathering, especially in colder and drier climates such as found in the extensive agricultural lands of Western Canada and the Western United States.

Mass deployment of these terrestrial CDR technologies to reverse climate change therefore cannot be achieved without a substantial intensification of agricultural output, i.e., producing more food on less land. This poses a major challenge, particularly in regions where arable land is little available or severely degraded and where agriculture is crucial to sustain people's livelihoods, such as the Global South. Enhanced silicate weathering, biochar amendment, and soil carbon sequestration are CDR techniques that avoid this competition for land and may even bring about multiple co-benefits for food production. This paper elaborates on the idea to take these latter CDR technologies a step further and use them not only to drawdown CO 2 from the atmosphere, but also to rebuild fertile soils ( negative erosion ) in areas that suffer from pervasive land degradation and have enough water available for agriculture. This way of engineering topsoil could contribute to the fight against malnutrition in areas where crop and livestock production currently is hampered by surface erosion and nutrient depletion, and thereby alleviate pressure on intact ecosystems. The thrust of this perspective is that synergistically applying multiple soil-related CDR strategies could restore previously degraded soil, allowing it to come back into food production (or become more productive), potentially alleviating pressure on intact ecosystems. In addition to removing CO 2 from the atmosphere, this practice could thus contribute to reducing poverty and hunger and to protection of biodiversity.",doi,tech|04,meth|05,cont|5,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.93,0.06,0.02,0.03,0.03,0.8,0.55,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.73,0.02,0.02,0.21,0.08,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.09,0.94,yes,https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2022.928403,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,1,1

Among the suitable silicates (such as basalt and olivine), the fast-weathering mineral wollastonite (CaSiO3) stands out. Not only does the use of wollastonite lead to rapid pedogenic carbonate formation in soils, it can be readily detected for verification of carbon sequestration, but its weathering within weeks to months influences soil chemistry and plant growth within the same crop cycle of its application. This enables a variety of short-term experimental agronomic studies to be conducted to demonstrate in an accelerated manner what could take years to be observed with more abundant but slower weathering silicates. This study presents the results of three studies that were conducted to investigate three distinct aspects of wollastonite skarn weathering in soils in the context of both agricultural and horticultural plants. The first study investigated the effect of a wide range of wollastonite skarn dosages in soil (1.5-10 wt.%) on the growth of green beans. The second study provides insights on the role of silicon (Si) release during silicate weathering on plant growth (soybeans and lettuce). The third study investigated the effect of wollastonite skarn on the growth of spring rye when added to soil alongside a nitrogen-based coated fertilizer. The results of these three studies provide further evidence that amending soil with crushed silicate rocks leads to climate-smart farming, resulting in inorganic carbon sequestration, as well as better plant growth in agricultural (soybean and spring rye) and horticultural (green bean and lettuce) crops.

Negative emissions technologies (NET) such as enhanced weathering will play a significant role in these efforts in the coming decades. Enhanced weathering is based on the terrestrial application of powdered natural or synthetic silicate minerals to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. In the latter case, non-hazardous industrial waste (NHIW) can react with water and CO2 from the atmosphere to achieve carbon drawdown through the acceleration of the naturally occurring weathering process. This approach also addresses the problem of sustainable industrial waste management. Besides, carbon drawdown also enhances soil quality for agricultural application sites. In the future, planning the large-scale implementation of enhanced weathering via carbon management networks can be facilitated by using optimization models. In this work, a source-sink model is developed for the proper allocation of NHIW to application sites. The method is demonstrated with a case study based at Shandong Province, China. Two scenarios are analyzed, with both achieving significant negative CO2 emissions. The CO2 sequestration rates for these two scenarios are determined as 12.73 Mt/y and 13.77 Mt/y, respectively. Scenario 1 shows that the system can achieve negative CO2 emissions at a cost of $ 184.25/t CO2, which is comparable to previously reported cost estimates.

However, many of the controls on precipitation and subsequent effects on soil properties remain poorly understood. In this study, engineered soil plots, with different ratios of concrete or dolerite combined with sand, have been used to investigate relationships between sequestered inorganic carbon and geotechnical properties, over a two-year period. Cone penetration tests with porewater pressure measurements (CPTu) were conducted to determine changes in tip resistance and pore pressure. C and O isotope analysis was carried out to confirm the pedogenic origin of carbonate minerals. TIC analysis shows greater precipitation of pedogenic carbonate in plots containing concrete than those with dolerite, with the highest sequestration values of plots containing each material being equivalent to 33.7 t C ha-1 yr-1 and 17.5 t C ha-1 yr-1, respectively, calculated from extrapolation of results derived from the TIC analysis. TIC content showed reduction or remained unchanged for the top 0.1 m of soil; at a depth of 0.2 m however, for dolerite plots, a pattern of seasonal accumulation and loss of TIC emerged. CPTu tip resistance measurements showed that the presence of carbonates had no observable effect on penetration resistance, and in the case of porewater pressure measurements, carbonate precipitation does not change the permeability of the substrate, and so does not affect drainage. The results of this study indicate that both the addition of dolerite and concrete serve to enhance CO2 removal in soils, that soil temperature appears to be a control on TIC precipitation, and that mineral carbonation in constructed soils does not lead to reduced drainage or an increased risk of flooding.",doi,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.68,0.03,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.06,0.89,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.82,0.39,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115016,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,6,2,0,0,1,1

One possible method for delivering on these goals is enhanced rock weathering, which involves modifying soils with crushed silicate rocks, such as basalt. Here we use dynamic carbon budget modelling to assess the carbon dioxide removal potential and agricultural benefits of implementing enhanced rock weathering strategies across UK arable croplands. We find that enhanced rock weathering could deliver net carbon dioxide removal of 6‚Äì30 MtCO2 yr‚àí1 for the United Kingdom by 2050, representing up to 45% of the atmospheric carbon removal required nationally to meet net-zero emissions. This suggests that enhanced rock weathering could play a crucial role in national climate mitigation strategies if it were to gain acceptance across national political, local community and farm scales. We show that it is feasible to eliminate the energy-demanding requirement for milling rocks to fine particle sizes.

Timely and effective measures to curb CO2 increases are thus needed in order to mitigate the potential degradation of natural ecosystems, food security, and livelihood caused by anthropogenic release of CO2. Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) on croplands and hinterlands may be one of the most economically and ecologically effective ways to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere, given that these soil environments generally favor mineral dissolution and because amending soils with crushed rock can result in a number of co-benefits to plant growth and crop yield. However, robust quantitative evaluation of CO2 capture by ERW in terrestrial soil systems that can lead to coherent policy implementation will require an ensemble of traceable mechanistic models that are optimized for simulating ERW in managed systems. Here, we present a new 1D reactive transport model ‚Äì SCEPTER. The model is designed to (1) mechanistically simulate natural weathering, including dissolution/precipitation of minerals along with uplift/erosion of solid phases, advection plus diffusion of aqueous phases and diffusion of gas phases, (2) allow targeted addition of solid phases at the soil‚Äìatmosphere interface, including multiple forms of organic matter (OM) and crushed mineral/rock feedstocks, (3) implement a range of soil mixing regimes as catalyzed by soil surface fauna (e.g., bioturbation) or humans (e.g., various forms of tilling), and (4) enable calculation of solid mineral surface area based on controlled initial particle size distributions coupled to a shrinking core framework. Here we describe the model structure and intrinsic thermodynamic/kinetic data, provide a series of idealized simulations to demonstrate the basic behavior of the code, and evaluate the computational and mechanistic performance of the model against observational data.

ERW accelerates atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) drawdown in agricultural soils following the addition of crushed, silicate rocks. The application of basalt, an abundant silicate rock, has widely been proposed for ERW. In order to measure and model the efficacy of ERW, it is critical to fully characterise the mineralogical composition of the basaltic materials being deployed in laboratory to catchment scale experiments. As previously demonstrated on analogous basaltic rock and soil materials on Mars, thermal analytical methods such as coupled thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TGA-MS), provide a potentially rapid, effective technique to identify and also quantify the carbonate mineral species present in ERW basalts and their weathering products. Our study of six different basaltic materials used in ERW experiments, from widely different geological and geographical settings, suggests that TGA weight losses can provide useful information on the low-levels of carbonate minerals present. Furthermore, carbonate mineral identification and quantification derived from the accompanying MS-detected CO2 evolution and corroborated by SEM-EDS mapping, is capable of detecting even lower concentrations with detection limits below 100 ppm for calcite. TGA-MS therefore offers significant advantages over the traditionally-applied inorganic carbon analyses. Carbonate mineral weight losses encountered during TGA and their accompanying CO2-evolutions have previously been ascribed to relatively small, defined temperature ranges. However, crucially, this study has revealed the concentration-dependent, large-scale variation in the mass spectrometric peak CO2-evolution for a range of carbonate minerals. A knowledge of such parameters is imperative for the accurate interpretation of basalt TGA-MS output, the characterisation of these materials and assessment of ERW technologies.",doi,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.05,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.06,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.88,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.99,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105465,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,2,62,0,0,0,1,1

Tipper,The efficacy of enhancing carbonate weathering for carbon dioxide sequestration,"Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom","Enhanced weathering is a geoengineering strategy aiming to increase continental weathering rates, thereby increasing the delivery of atmospheric carbon (as HCO3- ) to the oceans. Most enhanced weathering studies focus on the capacity of silicate rocks (e.g., basalt) and minerals (e.g., olivine, Mg 2 SiO 4 , or wollastonite CaSiO 3 ) to remove atmospheric CO 2 . However, carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite, CaCO 3 ) could provide an additional, rapid way to increase HCO3- export to the oceans. Recent studies suggest that 0.84 Gt C yr ‚àí1 could be removed from the atmosphere through the enhanced dissolution of calcite in soils, provided carbonic acid is the main dissolution agent. What is not clear is whether atmospheric CO 2 dissolved in soils can be transported by rivers, which typically have lower [pCO 2 ], to the oceans. This difference in calcite solubility between soils (where weathering occurs) and rivers (where HCO3- is transported) may lead to large amounts of secondary carbonate formation during transport, releasing the CO 2 consumed through dissolution. Here, we present a modeling study comparing the estimated soil dissolution capacity (SDC) in 149 of Earth's largest river basins, to the potential transport capacity of carbon (PTCC) in corresponding rivers. We find the SDC can only be exported to the oceans, without secondary carbonate precipitation, if rivers are in disequilibrium with respect to calcite (i.e., SIc = 1). In this instance, 0.92 Gt C yr ‚àí1 may be sequestered above background weathering rates, which is ~20% of annual increases in atmospheric carbon. If rivers are at equilibrium with calcite (i.e., SIc = 0), approximately two-thirds of the carbon dissolved in soil waters are lost due to calcite precipitation in rivers, and just 0.26 Gt of additional atmospheric C yr ‚àí1 can be transported to the oceans. Overall, the efficacy of enhanced carbonate weathering is a function of the capacity rivers have for transporting the products from carbonate weathering to the oceans, rather than the dissolution capacity of soils. These findings have implications for the efficiency of enhancing silicate weathering for ocean alkalinity enhancement, as secondary carbonate precipitation during transport is not always considered.",doi,tech|11,meth|03,cont|5,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.73,0.97,0.02,0.01,0.07,0.04,0.01,0.06,0.01,0.01,0.5,0.02,0.18,0.02,0.01,0.03,0.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.99,yes,https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2022.928215,1,0,0,0,0,1,9,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,1,1

There is, however, a pressing need to verify model predictions through long-term field trials. Here we report results from the first 3 years of an ongoing enhanced weathering field trial, carried out on an oil palm plantation in Sabah, Malaysia. Crushed silicate rock was applied to three hydrologically isolated catchments, and three adjacent (paired) reference catchments were left untreated. The drawdown of atmospheric CO 2 was quantified via the export of alkalinity in stream waters and changes in soil carbonate content. The amended and reference catchments were found to have a similar extent of CO 2 drawdown via alkalinity export [respectively, 3.8 ¬± 0.8 (1 SD) and 3.7 ¬± 0.6 (1 SD) tCO 2 ha ‚àí1 ] when all catchments were averaged over the study period (October 2018 to July 2021). However, differences were observed between the different catchment pairs (plots): two of the plots displayed a similar extent of CO 2 removal for both the amended and reference catchments, but the third amended catchment had a higher extent of CO 2 removal of ~1 tCO 2 ha ‚àí1 relative to its adjacent reference catchment. The difference in CO 2 removal rates determined for this plot can likely be attributed to increased weathering of silicate minerals in the amended catchment. Soil carbonate concentrations were on average &amp;lt;0.2 wt% CaCO 3 , but we report a small increase of ~0.03 wt% CaCO 3 in the top 30 cm of soil in the amended soils relative to the reference catchments. The magnitude of CO 2 drawdown via alkalinity export determined for these agricultural catchments is around an order of magnitude higher than in natural forested catchments in Sabah and similar to that of basaltic catchments. We show that these high weathering rates are primarily driven by weathering of carbonate fertilizers.

Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a vital negative emissions technology that applied globally could remove gigatonnes of CO2 per year from the atmosphere. In ERW, silicate minerals exposed to the atmosphere trap CO2 via mineral carbonation as thermodynamically stable carbonates. To obtain an atomic scale understanding of the weathering process and to design more reactive silicates for enhanced rock weathering, CO2 adsorption on low index wollastonite (CaSiO3) surfaces was modeled using density functional theory. Atomic scale structure of (100), (010), and (001) surfaces of wollastonite was predicted and the thermodynamics of their interaction with CO2 was modeled. Based on surface energy calculations, (001) and (010) surfaces of wollastonite exhibit similar stabilities, while (100) surface is found to be least stable. Depending on the surface structure and chemistry, different CO2 adsorption geometries are possible. A common trend emerges, wherein CO2 adsorbs molecularly and demonstrates proclivity to bond with surface layer calcium and oxygen binding sites. Mechanisms for electronic charge transfer between the adsorbate and the substrate were studied to shed light on the fundamental aspects of these interactions.

A greenhouse gas (GHG) removal technology (GGRT) is one that can remove a GHG from the atmosphere. Enhanced silicate rock weathering for long-term CO2 sequestration has considerable potential as a GGRT, but depends on the availability of suitable rocks coupled with proximity to locations where it can be applied. Extracting, processing, transporting and applying ground rock to land consume energy and thus generate GHG emissions, which must be balanced against the sequestration potential. In this study, we i) assess the environmental impacts of the practice, using existing basalt rock quarrying in Sao Paulo (SP) state by considering the emissions associated with the rock extraction, comminution, transport and application through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach; ii) estimate the contribution of the different processes involved with soil carbonation and enhanced weathering and iii) assess the potential net CO2 removal of Sao Paulo agricultural land through soil carbonation and weathering of basalt rock. Our results show that enhanced weathering and carbonation respectively emit around 75 and 135 kg CO2eq per tonne of CO2eq removed (considering an average quarry to field distance of 65 km.) We underline transportation as the principal process negatively affecting the practice and establish a limiting road travel distance from quarry to field of 540 ¬± 65 km for carbonation and 990 ¬± 116 km for enhanced weathering. Above these distances, the GHG emissions exceed the potential sequestration. The application of crushed basalt at 1 t/ha to all of Sao Paulo State‚Äôs 12 million hectares of agricultural land could capture around 1.3 to 2.4 Mt CO2eq through carbonation and enhanced weathering, respectively. If 50 t/ha is applied, the sequestration potential could reach up to 40 to 76 % of the total Sao Paulo State emissions in 2016 through carbonation and enhanced weathering respectively, assuming no loss in the effectiveness of basalt at high application rates. This study lowers previous net sequestration estimates from Kantola et al. (2017) by around 50% and, as various techniques are increasingly promoted as efficient solutions to remove or sequester CO2, it emphasizes the need to consider the practice in its entirety to show the limitations and potential caveats. The holistic approach of LCA helps identify processes with the most impact and their significance. However, its accuracy and reliability is inevitably limited by the amount, quality and representativeness of the input data.

Hence, to minimize environmental risks of enhanced weathering, basalts with low heavy metal concentrations should be favored. Existing phytoremediation strategies may be used to ‚Äúphytoprevent‚Äù the accumulation of nickel and chromium released from enhanced weathering in soils. As a result, elevated nickel and chromium concentrations in rocks must not preclude enhanced weathering in all settings. In particular, hyperaccumulating plants could be used as part of a crop rotation to periodically remove heavy metals from soils. Enhanced weathering could also be employed on fields or forests of (non-hyper) accumulating plants that have a high primary production of biomass. Both approaches may have additional synergies with phytomining or bioenergy carbon capture and storage, increasing the total amount of carbon dioxide drawdown and at the same time preventing heavy metal accumulation in soils.",doi,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.03,0.02,0.02,0.03,0.16,0.03,0.03,0.01,0.03,0.03,0.93,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.86,0.02,0.01,0.11,0.06,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2021.820204,7,3,0,11,21,3,8,0,1,0,16,7,53,56,1,1

This technique relies on the acceleration of naturally occurring weathering reactions with water and carbon dioxide by reducing these substances into a fine powder with high specific surface area. The ex situ enhanced weathering process chain consists of the acquisition of suitable natural or synthetic materials, grinding to a fine particle size, transportation, and application on suitable sites. Future enhanced weathering systems can be envisioned as supply chain-like networks which have to be optimized to deliver maximum CDR given physical constraints. There is a notable research gap in the literature on decision support for such systems. To address this gap, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed in this work to optimize enhanced weathering networks for CDR.

In real soils, however, weathering rates may differ strongly from lab conditions. Research on natural weathering has shown that biota such as plants, microbes, and macro-invertebrates can strongly affect weathering rates, but biotic effects were excluded from most ESW lab assessments.

However, quantification of inorganic carbon sequestration through EW and potential risks in terms of heavy metal contamination have rarely been assessed. Here, we investigate EW in a mesocosm experiment with Solanum tuberosum growing on alkaline soil. Amendment with 50 t basalt/ha significantly increased alkalinity in soil pore water and in the leachate losses, indicating significant basalt weathering. We did not find a significant change in TIC, which was likely because the duration of the experiment (99 days) was too short for carbonate precipitation to become detectable. A 1D reactive transport model (PHREEQC) predicted 0.77 t CO 2 /ha sequestered over the 99 days of the experiment and 1.83 and 4.48 t CO 2 /ha after 1 and 5 years, respectively. Comparison of experimental and modeled cation pore water Mg concentrations at the onset of this experiment showed a factor three underestimation of Mg concentrations by the model and hence indicates an underestimation of modeled CO 2 sequestration. Moreover, pore water Ca concentrations were underestimated, indicating that the calcite precipitation rate was overestimated by this model. Importantly, basalt amendment did not negatively affect potato growth and yield (which even tended to increase), despite increased Al availability in this alkaline soil.

However, the effectiveness of such systems is still in doubt, owing to the unrealistic models used for prediction and the insufficient consideration of the dynamic influences of soils on fluid chemistry. We determined the effectiveness of such systems for atmospheric CO 2 removal, along with their characteristics, through a set of batch- and flow-through-type laboratory experiments, using andosol and decomposed granite soil as agricultural and non-agricultural soils, respectively, and Portland cement, steelmaking slag, and coal fly ash as industrial byproducts. The results of the batch-type experiments demonstrated that agricultural soils were suitable for CO 2 removal, owing to their moderately high pH and Ca concentrations in pore water that prevented intensive calcium carbonate precipitation. The flow-through experiments demonstrated that a higher Ca-content byproduct can have a large atmospheric CO 2 removal capacity. However, the magnitude of CO 2 removal and its time-dependent behavior were difficult to predict because they were not in conjunction with the changes in the average pH value. This indicated that the diffusive transport of CO 2 from the atmosphere-soil interface to deeper soils was more complex than expected.

Carbonate weathering contributes most of the dissolved inorganic carbon measured in inland waters, chiefly as HCO3‚àí, though carbonate rock covers only a minor proportion of continental surface (~15%). The fast kinetics of carbonate weathering leads the trace carbonate to contribute greater HCO3‚àí loads than silicate even in silicate catchments. Thus, the uses of carbonate powders on continental surface with silicate via agricultural liming can potentially enhance the CO2 removal. Here, using an equilibrium modeling approach and results of the CMIP6 GCM model, we estimate the actual total CO2 removal (ATCR) by the weathering of both carbonate bedrock and carbonate-rich soils, at the global scale. The potential CO2 removal (PCR) which can be achieved by spreading carbonate powders on non‚Äëcarbonate lands is also estimated. The results show that the ATCR at present is approximately 0.166 Gt yr‚àí1, which is similar to the previous result estimated from the global river data base.

Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) on the land surface is one extensively discussed approach toward carbon dioxide removal (CDR), but the capacity of rivers to carry dissolved products derived from ERW without CO 2 re‚Äêrelease is largely unexplored, hindering a full understanding of the life cycle of ERW and its associated maximum CDR potential.

Although these limits will be challenging to achieve in practice, our results support the notion that the transport of dissolved constituents in surface waters is unlikely to be a primary bottleneck limiting the CDR potential of ERW. This supports the notion that accelerated mineral weathering should be considered as an additional component of greenhouse gas mitigation portfolios.

This technology relies on accelerating the natural process of mineral weathering in soils by manipulating the abiotic variables that govern this process, in particular mineral grain size and exposure to acids dissolved in water. EW mainly aims at reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations by enhancing inorganic carbon sequestration. Until now, knowledge of EW has been mainly gained through experiments that focused on the abiotic variables known for stimulating mineral weathering, thereby neglecting the potential influence of biotic components. While bacteria, fungi, and earthworms are known to increase mineral weathering rates, the use of soil organisms in the context of EW remains underexplored. This protocol describes the design and construction of an experimental setup developed to enhance mineral weathering rates through soil organisms while concurrently controlling abiotic conditions. The setup is designed to maximize weathering rates while maintaining soil organisms' activity. It consists of a large number of columns filled with rock powder and organic material, located in a climate chamber and with water applied via a downflow irrigation system.

The majority of anthropogenic N 2 O emissions (52‚Äì80%) come from agricultural settings due to high rates of reactive nitrogen fertilizer application.

For a onetime forsterite application of ~ 16 kg/m2, complete weathering within five years can be achieved, giving an equivalent carbon removal rate of ~ 2.3 kgCO2/m2/yr.

We showed that the in situ weathering rate can be enhanced by conditions and operations that maintain high CO2 availability via effective transport of atmospheric CO2 (e.g. in well-drained soils) and/or sufficient biogenic CO2 supply (e.g. stimulated plant-microbe processes). Our results further highlight that the effect of increasing surface area on weathering rate can be significant-so that the energy penalty of reducing the grain size may be justified-only when CO2 supply is nonlimiting.

We compare different trace element accumulation scenarios considering a range of rock sources, application rates and national regulatory limits.

However, the environment-driven mechanisms of ERW remain unclear, and the uncertainty on crop productivity also requires further evaluation in field trials. We tried to explore the response of crop productivity and soil inorganic carbon to ERW in farmland and analyze the contribution and prioritization of environment drivers for the above change. A series of monitoring trials were established in a multi-agroclimatic region in central China from 2019 to 2021. Firstly, crop productivity and SIC change mediated by ERW were evaluated by applying 10 kg m‚àí2 mixed rock powder in field trials. Secondly, the random forest and correlation network analysis were used to quantify the influence of climate, soil, and management drivers on yield and SIC change. Finally, the carbon footprint of silicate rock powder was calculated by life cycle analysis.

The formation and accumulation of pedogenic carbonate and bicarbonate in soils/subsoils and groundwater offers a large sink for C storage; the amount of soil inorganic carbon (SIC) presently held within soils has been estimated to be 720-950 Gt of C. These values can be augmented by the addition of a variety of calcium and magnesium silicates via enhanced weathering. While the concept of the application of finely milled silicate rocks for faster weathering rates is well established, there has been limited discussion on the role of local climate, natural SIC content (i.e., the SIC innately present in the soil), and soil pH (among other important agronomic factors) on silicate weathering when applied to croplands, especially in view that the aim is to establish terrestrial enhanced weathering as a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategy on a global scale.

Previous estimates have suggested that enhanced silicate weathering (EW) has the potential to remove significant quantities of CO2, as much as 6‚Äì30 Mt CO2 yr‚àí1 for the UK. However, if secondary carbonates are precipitated during the riverine transport of the products of EW, a portion of this CO2 will be re-released, lowering the net carbon dioxide removal (CDR) potential of the mitigation strategy. Here, we assess the fluvial response to EW in the UK by calculating the expected riverine carbonate precipitation due to the dissolution of 10‚Äì50 t ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1 of silicate rock on available arable cropland in major UK catchments. Increases in calcite saturation due to the export of soluble cations sourced from EW from soil to rivers are simulated to cross thresholds for spontaneous carbonate precipitation in several major UK river catchments (e.g. the Great Ouse, Thames). Catchments most susceptible to potential secondary carbonate precipitation are those with a high ratio of cropland to water discharge. On average, carbonate precipitation for major UK catchments is expected to make EW 16% (10 t ha‚àí1), 21% (20 t ha‚àí1) or 27% (50 t ha‚àí1) less effective at removing CO2 than that predicted in the absence of such precipitation. Furthermore, when placing strict silica limitations on weathering reactions within soils, the CDR potential of EW is reduced considerably, to 0.23 Mt CO2 yr‚àí1. Although reducing the CDR potential of EW, we suggest that under rapid weathering conditions, carbonate precipitation in UK rivers will prevent pH increases over the safe level for freshwater ecosystems (pH > 9). Together, the simulations suggest that ambient hydrological conditions may make certain UK agricultural areas less effective for CDR by EW and call for methods to quantify secondary carbonate precipitation in response to EW treatments and to further investigate the role of silica saturation in suppressing weathering reactions.",doi,tech|10,meth|02,cont|5,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.13,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.89,0.03,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.09,0.01,0.93,0.13,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2023.105643,0,0,2,0,0,0,7,1,0,0,49,2,0,0,1,1

The effectiveness of EW was tested over 4 years by spreading ground basalt (50 t ha-1 year-1 ) on maize/soybean and miscanthus cropping systems in the Midwest US. The major elements of the carbon budget were quantified through measurements of eddy covariance, soil carbon flux, and biomass. The movement of Mg and Ca to deep soil, released by weathering, balanced by a corresponding alkalinity flux, was used to measure the drawdown of CO2 , where the release of cations from basalt was measured as the ratio of rare earth elements to base cations in the applied rock dust and in the surface soil. Basalt application stimulated peak biomass and net primary production in both cropping systems and caused a small but significant stimulation of soil respiration. Net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was strongly negative for maize/soybean (-199 to -453 g C m-2 year-1 ) indicating this system was losing carbon to the atmosphere. Average EW (102 g C m-2 year-1 ) offset carbon loss in the maize/soybean by 23%-42%. NECB of miscanthus was positive (63-129 g C m-2 year-1 ), indicating carbon gain in the system, and EW greatly increased inorganic carbon storage by an additional 234 g C m-2 year-1 . Our analysis indicates a co-deployment of a perennial biofuel crop (miscanthus) with EW leads to major wins-increased harvested yields of 29%-42% with additional carbon dioxide removal (CDR) of 8.6 t CO2 ha-1 year-1 . EW applied to maize/soybean drives a CDR of 3.7 t CO2 ha-1 year-1 , which partially offsets well-established carbon losses from soil from this crop rotation.

Although research on EW is gaining traction, the missing elements in the literature however are the supply chain sustainability impacts associated with large-scale production and deployment of crushed silicates for EW purposes. The need to conduct sustainability assessments for EW systems in addition to validated technical feasibility remains a relevant research gap. In this work, the potential economic and environmental impacts associated with production of crushed silicates is assessed for eight countries, belonging to two separate groups: emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and developed economies (USA, UK, France, and Germany). A total of six economic and environmental impact categories are included in the assessment; gross domestic product (GDP), gross operating surplus (GOS), imports, greenhouse gas emissions, energy, and material use. The input-output model is used to estimate the economy-wide and macro-level sustainability impacts derived from producing crushed silicates. Findings show developed economies have relatively high levels of positive economic benefits and may experience less negative environmental impacts within their national boundaries by ‚Äòleaking‚Äô such impacts via imports. Imported consumption for crushed silicate production in developed countries were found to be substantially higher than that of emerging economies. For the emerging economies, imported consumption associated with crushed silicate production constitutes on average, less than 10% whereas for developed economies, imported consumption averages 20%. The UK mining and quarrying sector has the highest imported consumption at approximately 30%.

With rising temperatures and more frequent droughts due to climate change, it becomes more challenging to keep up with this increased demand for food. Therefore, a change in land use and management is needed in which enhanced silicate weathering (ESW) can play an important role. Weathering of silicate rocks has been regulating the atmospheric CO2 concentrations for over decades, but with the rise in atmospheric CO2, the natural weathering is too slow. Grinding the silicate rocks into a fine powder and spread it over for example agricultural fields will increase the reactive surface area and hence, the amount of CO2 that is stored in soils. The application of silicate minerals to soils can enhance plant growth by multiple processes, for example by counteracting soil acidification and by the release of plant nutrients. In this way, ESW can be used on agricultural fields without competing for land like other carbon capture techniques (e.g. Bio-Energy with carbon capture and storage). This study investigates the use of olivine (a fast-weathering Mg-rich silicate mineral) as a fertilizer in agriculture using a full-factorial mesocosm experiment. Barley and wheat were grown under two different rain regimes (daily rain vs weekly rain) and with application of two different grain sizes of olivine (p80 = 1020 &amp;#181;m and p80 = 43.5 &amp;#181;m). Our results showed increased plant growth and biomass with olivine addition, albeit only for fine olivine. However, this was not translated in an increase in yield of wheat and barley. Besides changes in biomass, we found significant differences in plant nutrient concentrations. As expected, Mg concentration increased significantly. However, BSi and Ca concentrations decreased with fine olivine application. Nitrogen in grains was also increased in the fine olivine treatment. In contrast to fine olivine, coarse olivine addition had almost no influence on nutrients. Ca, Mg and Si concentrations in plant samples followed the same trend as in the soil pore water, in contrast to metal concentrations. Olivine addition increased Ni and Cr availability in the soil pore water, but the concentrations of these elements in plant tissue did not increase and were even below detection limit for the majority of samples. While the influence of olivine on metal concentrations in plant samples was not affected by rain treatment, the influence of olivine on nutrients in the plants and plant growth was. Fine olivine addition enhanced the plants resistance to drought as it reduced the decrease in biomass with weekly rain treatment compared to daily rain treatment. This positive effect of olivine addition can be due to the increased weathering rate in combination with enhancement of soil properties like increased soil water retention. In this way, the use of olivine as a fertilizer on agricultural fields can mitigate climate change while it can also contribute to the solution for increased food demand.",title,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.04,0.02,0.02,0.04,0.15,0.03,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.93,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.01,0.23,0.88,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-15333,2,0,0,5,3,265,16,0,0,0,0,1,20,17,1,1

However, unintended biogeochemical interactions with the nitrogen cycle may arise through ERW increasing soil pH as basalt grains undergo dissolution that may reinforce, counteract, or even offset the climate benefits from carbon sequestration. Increases in soil pH could drive changes in the soil emissions of key non-CO2 greenhouse gases, e.g., nitrous oxide (N2O), and trace gases, e.g., nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3), that affect air quality and crop and human health. We present the development and implementation of a new improved nitrogen cycling scheme for the Community Land Model v5 (CLM5), the land component of the Community Earth System Model, allowing evaluation of ERW effects on soil gas emissions. We base the new parameterizations on datasets derived from soil pH responses of N2O, NO, and NH3 in ERW field trial and mesocosm experiments with crushed basalt. These new capabilities involve the direct implementation of routines within the CLM5 N cycle framework, along with asynchronous coupling of soil pH changes estimated through an ERW model. We successfully validated simulated ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù (i.e., no ERW) seasonal cycles of soil N2O, NO, and NH3 emissions against a wide range of global emission inventories. We benchmark simulated mitigation of soil N2O fluxes in response to ERW against a subset of data from ERW field trials in the US Corn Belt. Using the new scheme, we provide a specific example of the effect of large-scale ERW deployment with croplands on soil nitrogen fluxes across five key regions with high potential for CDR with ERW (North America, Brazil, Europe, India, and China). Across these regions, ERW implementation led to marked reductions in N2O and NO (both 18 %), with moderate increases in NH3 (2 %). While further developments are still required in our implementations when additional ERW data become available, our improved N cycle scheme within CLM5 has utility for investigating the potential of ERW point-source and regional effects of soil N2O, NO, and NH3 fluxes in response to current and future climates. This framework also provides the basis for assessing the implications of ERW for air quality given the role of NO in tropospheric ozone formation, as well as both NO and NH3 in inorganic aerosol formation.",doi,tech|10,meth|02,cont|5,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.17,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.93,0.03,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.01,0.05,0.04,0.98,0.03,0.01,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.04,0.93,yes,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5783-2023,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,1,1

The basalts chosen for this study (with their mineralogical compositions) are the Blue Ridge (BR) meta-basalt (chlorite > epidote > plagioclase > actinolite) and Pioneer Valley (PV) basalt (plagioclase > augite > quartz > chlorite). Powders of BR and PV basalts were sieved into 150 Œºm fractions, and experiments were performed in open-system reactors designed to simulate a 1 mm thick layer of basalt added to agricultural soil in the humid tropics. Weathering rate was assessed by measuring the flux of base cations leached from silicate minerals and results indicate that silt-dominated basaltic powder (<45 Œº m) weathers at approximately double the rate of sand dominated (150‚Äì500 Œº m) basaltic powder, both for the BR and PV basalts. This study estimates CDR rates between 2.8 and 6.8 t CO2/ha/yr across the range of grain size fractions analyzed. Etched primary mineral grains (e.g. plagioclase, augite, actinolite) with depleted base cations observed by SEM-EDS provide morphological and stoichiometric evidence of dissolution, as do the presence of frayed chlorite grains that contain adsorbed Ca and are compositionally intermediate to end-member chlorite and smectite. Small amounts of micron-scale calcite were also observed as a precipitate on mineral surfaces, likely a consequence of localized saturation of Ca and HCO3 in the matrix of the weathering powders.

However, the reliable quantification of weathering rates and prognoses for effects of various environmental conditions on weathering are lacking. This currently inhibits the monitoring, reporting and verification of CO2 capture and hampers the exploitation of the carbon dioxide removal economy. A mineral dissolution model was developed, and olivine weathering rates were directly coupled to particle sizes of the ground mineral. A particle size-dependent calculation approach, based on the shrinking core model, showed faster weathering rates as compared to a single-size, monodisperse approach. This provided a better underpinning of the prediction of the overall weathering and, consequently, the sequestration rate of CO2. Weathering of olivine releases nickel, which is incorporated in the mineral.

The rate and efficacy of ERW in agricultural soils to remove CO2 is difficult to quantify owing to the complex geochemical environment including biological-mineral-fluid-atmosphere interactions and human interventions that occur. Column experiments containing wollastonite [CaSiO3] and soils were conducted to investigate the geochemical processes that remove CO2 during ERW, and to determine the potential impact of P-bearing fertilizers on CO2 removal. Columns containing wollastonite, soil, or 8:1 soil-wollastonite mixtures were irrigated with de-ionized water or a 1 √ó 10‚àí4 M K3PO4 solution. Analysis of column effluent concentrations indicated that P was rapidly removed from solution and retained within the columns, with little difference in weathering rate between columns irrigated with water and those receiving the K3PO4 solution. Bulk wollastonite weathering rates were significantly enhanced in the presence of soils compared to columns with wollastonite alone. Cation concentrations in effluent from columns with soil-wollastonite mixtures were strongly impacted by adsorption to soil surfaces, complicating efforts to estimate CO2 capture. Based on wollastonite weathering rates estimated by Si release, a maximum of 255 kg CO2 t‚àí1 amendment yr‚àí1 was captured in the soil-wollastonite mixture columns. The majority of CO2 stored in the soil-bearing columns was most likely soil-generated rather than removed directly from the atmosphere. The results of this study indicate that adsorption to soils may limit the ability of P to enhance wollastonite weathering, that silicate weathering behaviour within soils differs substantially from that of pure mineral phases, and that CO2 budgets must be carefully constrained to assess the source of stored CO2. Moreover, leachate concentrations of cations and HCO3‚àí may not serve as accurate indicators of the extent of silicate weathering, at least over the short term, due to the numerous processes that control their concentrations in soils, such as sorption to soil components.",doi,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.27,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.88,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.03,0.98,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105511,0,0,0,0,0,3,9,1,0,0,7,322,2,0,1,1

Soils having lower pH values responded to wollastonite addition with a higher increase in CO2 emissions.

When applied to agricultural soils, the resulting increase in soil pH and release of nutrients may co-benefit plant productivity. Silicate minerals and rocks differ in their enhanced weathering potential , i.e., their potential for both carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) sequestration and soil quality improvements. However, studies comparing silicate minerals and rocks for this dual potential are lacking. Therefore, we compared the enhanced weathering potential of olivine (Mg 2 SiO 4 ), basalt, wollastonite (CaSiO 3 ), and two minerals that are novel in this context, anorthite (CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 ) and albite (NaAlSi 3 O 8 ). A down-flow soil column experiment was designed allowing for measurements on soils and leachate, and calculations of organic and inorganic carbon budgets. Our results showed comparatively high CO 2 capture by enhanced wollastonite and olivine weathering. Furthermore, CO 2 capture per m 2 specific surface area indicated potential for enhanced anorthite and albite weathering. Calculated carbon budgets showed that most treatments produced net CO 2 emissions from soils, likely related to the short duration of this experiment. All silicates generally improved soil quality, with soil nickel contents remaining below contamination limits. However, nickel concentrations in leachates from olivine-amended soils exceeded the groundwater threshold value, stressing the importance of monitoring nickel leaching. We found a relatively high enhanced weathering potential for wollastonite, while the potential for olivine may be constrained by nickel leaching.

At present, the rate and magnitude of CDR from EW remains uncertain. In this study, soil cores extracted from a typical UK agricultural site in Oxfordshire were used to geochemically assess the efficacy of EW while simulating field conditions. Six material ‚Äútreatments‚Äù were applied to soil cores at a rate equivalent to 50 t ha‚àí1: agricultural lime (aglime), basalt, cement kiln dust (CKD), olivine, steel slag, and volcanic ash. A range of chemical measurements were used to constrain the rate of dissolution, fate of dissolution products, and the CDR potential and environmental impact of treatment. After a single application, the CDR rates were, in decreasing order: steel slag (20 ¬± 4 kgCO2 ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1) > CKD (16 ¬± 4 kgCO2 ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1) > basalt (5 ¬± 3 kgCO2 ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1) > volcanic ash (3 ¬± 3 kgCO2 ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1) > aglime (2 ¬± 1 kgCO2 ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1) > olivine (0 ¬± 2 kgCO2 ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1). Despite its drawdown potential, steel slag addition is not advised because application raised the dissolved concentration of heavy metals in the soil. CKD application will be limited due to availability of this material. Liming of agricultural soil is normally considered a source of CO2, but this study indicates liming could cause CDR in some UK soil conditions. Extrapolating from this site to a wider scale supports the conclusions of recently published research which suggests 10 years of basalt application over UK cropland could remove 1.8 ¬± 0.9 MtCO2 yr‚àí1. Given the low rates of CDR observed in this study, EW is only likely to be worthwhile, at least in soil and climate conditions common to SE England, where there are co-benefits beyond carbon uptake.",doi,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.13,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.92,0.03,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.96,0.04,0.01,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167701,9,1,0,0,0,0,35,0,0,1,40,0,5,6,1,1

Synergies between these two processes have not been investigated. Here, we apply finely ground silicate rock mining residues (basalt and granite blend) to a loamy sand in a pot trial at a rate of 4% (equivalent to 50 t ha ‚àí1 ) and investigate the effects of a wheat plant and two watering regimes on soil carbon sequestration over the course of 6 months. Rock dust addition increased soil pH, electric conductivity, inorganic carbon content and soil‚Äêexchangeable Ca and Mg contents, as expected for weathering. However, it decreased exchangeable levels of micronutrients Mn and Zn, likely related to the elevated soil pH. Importantly, it increased mineral‚Äêassociated organic matter by 22% due to the supply of secondary minerals and associated sites for SOM sorption. Additionally, in the nonplanted treatments, rock supply of Ca and Mg increased soil microaggregation that subsequently stabilised labile particulate organic matter as organic matter occluded in aggregates by 46%. Plants, however, reduced soil‚Äêexchangeable Mg and Ca contents and hence counteracted the silicate rock effect on microaggregates and carbon within. We suggest this cation loss might be attributed to plant exudates released to solubilise micronutrients and hence neutralise plant deficiencies.

Novel and durable CDR strategies need to rapidly scale over the next few decades in order to reach Paris Agreement Targets. Terrestrial enhanced weathering (EW) involves the acceleration of natural weathering processes via the deployment of crushed rock feedstocks, typically Ca- and Mg-rich silicates, in soils. While models predict this has the potential to remove multiple gigatonnes of CO2 annually, as an open-system pathway, the measurement (monitoring), reporting, and verification (MRV) of carbon removal and storage is challenging. Here we provide a review of the current literature showing the state-of-play of different methods for monitoring EW. We focus on geochemical characterization of weathering processes at the weathering site itself, acknowledging that the final storage of carbon is largely in the oceans, with potential losses occurring during transfer. There are two main approaches for measuring EW, one focused on solid phase measurements, including exchangeable phases, and the other on the aqueous phase. Additionally, gas phase measurements have been employed to understand CO2 fluxes, but can be dominated by short-term organic carbon cycling. We stress that, although there is complexity in tracing EW CDR in the natural field environment, established literature validates existing approaches, and each approach has strengths and limitations. The complexity inherent in open-system CDR pathways is navigable through surplus measurement strategies and well designed experiments, which we highlight are critical in the early stage of the EW CDR industry.",title,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.07,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.84,0.05,0.02,0.01,0.05,0.06,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.96,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.31223/x52d7t,3,0,0,1,0,1,7,3,1,1,14,17,3,2,1,1

The aims of this study were to 1) assess the CDR potential of various sugarcane-mill ashes via EW, and 2) investigate the impact of soil conditions and mill ash properties on the CDR. This was done by characterising physical and chemical properties of five mill ashes from Australia and simulating weathering using a one-dimensional reactive transport model. The model was parameterised to simulate weathering of 100 t/ha of wet ash or crushed basalt for 15 years under various combinations of soil pH and carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2). A sensitivity analysis was undertaken in a two-level factorial design to test the effect of pH, pH buffering, material surface area, infiltration rate, plant uptake of nutrients, organic matter cation exchange surfaces, and pCO2 on modelled CDR. The simulated CDR of the mill ashes was significantly less than the basalt (p  0.05). Weathering of mill ash removed 0.0‚Äì4.0 t CO2/ha (0.00‚Äì0.040 t CO2/t wet ash) cumulatively, similar to some basalts and olivine modelled in the literature. The theoretical maximum CDR of the mill ashes (based on amount of weatherable material applied) was achieved in around 5 years. The estimate of CDR varied by orders of magnitude depending on conditions. It was least when initial soil solution pH was lowest (4.5, unbuffered), pH was at 6.5 or less with constant buffering, and pCO2 was low (600 ppm). CDR was also significantly lower when calculated directly from accumulation of carbon in dissolved and solid phases rather than stoichiometrically from cation release. The effects of pH and pH buffering quantified here may explain low measured CDR from EW in field trials on acidic soils and highlight the need for more realistic modelling of pH buffering capacity. Overall, mill ash shows high potential for CDR via EW, especially if lifecycle benefits are considered, although this must be validated in the field.",doi,tech|10,meth|02,cont|5,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.28,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.91,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.03,0.11,0.97,0.02,0.01,0.03,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2024.105940,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,42,2,0,1,1,1

Some of this CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; dissolves to form carbonic acid in soil waters. Natural weathering partially neutralizes this carbonic acid, but in recent years there has been much interest in using soil mineral and rock amendments (e.g. added olivine and basalt) to accelerate weathering-driven atmospheric CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; drawdown to counter rising atmospheric CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;.&amp;amp;#160; To be effective, accelerated weathering should result in increased dissolved bicarbonate (the main dissolved inorganic carbon carrier at circum-neutral pH) in drainage waters, as well as enhanced land-to-ocean fluxes of divalent metal cations such as Ca and Mg, ultimately to lock up the soil-derived inorganic carbon in marine limestones. Here we present new results for field experiments that investigate a novel soil amendment to sequester CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; from soil-gas via weathering; crushed returned concrete (CRC). Unlike previously investigated mafic and ultramafic materials for accelerated weathering approaches that generally require energy- and carbon-intensive mining, grinding and long-distance transport operations, CRC is a waste product that requires minimal crushing after post-return solidification at concrete plants to achieve high measured specific surface areas (c. 10 m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;/g).&amp;amp;#160; CRC is widely available globally because a few % of the &amp;gt;10Gt/year of concrete produced is typically returned unused to concrete ready-mix plants.&amp;amp;#160; Engineering codes preclude the reincorporation of this waste as aggregate in new concrete in many jurisdictions. This results in the widescale availability of this highly weatherable alkaline waste product that is often landfilled or sold as a low-value construction fill.&amp;amp;#160; Local availability of the material facilitates short haulage distances and relatively small energy and carbon footprints to transport the material to nearby field sites.&amp;amp;#160; In this pilot study, CRC was added to the upper 15 cms of a one-hectare trial tillage field in SE Ireland at a rate of 10 tonnes/hectare. Soil-water solutions were extracted for analysis using suction-cup lysimeters at monthly intervals from the amended and adjacent non-amended control sites to determine the geochemical impact of CRC on soil waters and to calculate weathering and therefore CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; uptake rates via carbonic acid neutralisation. Relative to adjacent control sites, concrete-amended sites exhibited significant increases in soil-water pH (by 0.2 to 0.5 pH units), a two- to three-fold increase in electrical conductivity (total ion load) and similar increases in soil-water Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, reflecting the weathering of portlandite and calcium silicates in the concrete. Field experiments are ongoing to assess the long-term effects of the concrete amendment on soil-water chemistry, soil pH and nutrient status. No increases in detrimental heavy metals (e.g. Ni, Cr) often associated with the use of mafic and ultramafic materials as soil amendments have been detected. Weathering is attributable entirely to carbonic acid neutralization, with no evidence for weathering by strong acids. Methods for the calculation of likely rates of CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; capture (tonnes CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; per tonne of amendment) and their associated uncertainties based on alkalinity increases, divalent metal exports and enhanced soil-leachable Ca will be discussed.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",author,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.22,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.92,0.03,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.95,0.01,0.01,0.05,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-4824,1,1,1,3,8,0,11,2,0,4,9,6,10,7,1,1

EC-Œ∏ sensors offer a cost-effective and straightforward alternative to traditional soil and water sampling methods. In a lab experiment, three different substrates were treated with NaHCO 3 solutions to increase the alkalinity of the soil water and analyze the response. The combination of EC and Œ∏ to track the increase in carbonate alkalinity due to EW, and therefore CO 2 consumption, is applicable for low cation exchange capacity (CEC) soil-substrates like the used quartz sand. However, the presence of organic material and pH-dependent CEC complicates the detection of clear weathering signals in soils. In organic-rich and clay-rich soils, only a high alkalinity addition has created a clear EC signal that could be distinguished from a non-alkaline baseline with purified water. Cation exchange experiments revealed that the used soil buffered alkalinity input and thereby might consume freshly generated alkalinity, initially mitigating CO 2 uptake effects from EW application. Effective CEC changes with pH and pH buffering capacity by other pathways need to be considered when quantifying the CO 2 sequestration potential by EW in soils. This should be estimated before the application of EW and should be part of the monitoring reporting and verification (MRV) strategy.

Golf courses regularly apply quartz-dominated sand as typical turfgrass management practice, and replacing quartz-dominated sand with weatherable silicate minerals holds the potential to provide CO2 sequestration benefits. This study reviewed the existing research and estimated net CO2 sequestration potential in scenarios involving the application of basaltic sand on golf courses. Basalt dissolution rate was strongly influenced by temperature, soil pH and grain size. Transportation of basalt material between quarry and golf course accounted for the majority of CO2 emissions, offsetting the potential CO2 sequestration benefits of enhanced basalt weathering, even when the source was located nearby. When environment favors, a 18-hole golf course in regions with an average temperature is greater than 25 ¬∞C and soil pH is approximately 8.5, the net CO2 sequestration potential achieved by substituting currently used quartz sand with basaltic sand on putting greens was a minimum 0.42 Mt CO2(eq) yr‚àí1. Expanding this substitution to encompass the entire maintained turfgrass area, including putting greens, fairways, tees, practice areas, and roughs, resulted in a minimum 11.56 Mt CO2(eq) yr‚àí1.

However, the current model-based assessments of EW potential face uncertainties stemming from the intricate interplay among soil physical, chemical, and biotic processes, compounded by the absence of a detailed model-data comparison, mostly due to the limited availability of comprehensive data. Here, we address this critical gap by advancing and validating an ecohydrological and biogeochemical model for EW dynamics in soils. We conduct a hierarchical validation in which model results are critically compared to four experimental datasets of increasing complexity, from simple closed incubation systems to open mesocosm experiments. The comparison demonstrates the model ability to capture the dynamics of primary variables, including rock alkalinity release and CO2 sequestration. The comparison also reveals that weathering rates are consistently lower than traditionally assumed by up to two orders of magnitude.

Here we report the carbon balance in an Icelandic Histic/Gleyic Andosol that has received large quantities of basaltic dust over 3,300 years, providing opportunity to quantify the rates and long-term consequences of enhanced rock weathering. The added basaltic dust has dissolved continuously since its deposition. The alkalinity of the soil waters is more than 10-times higher than in equivalent basalt-dust-free soils. After accounting for oxidation and degassing when the soil waters are exposed to the atmosphere, the annual CO 2 drawdown due to alkalinity generation is 0.17 tC ha -1 yr -1 . This study validates the ability of fine grained mafic mineral addition to soils to attenuate increasing atmospheric CO 2 by alkalinity export.

Santos,Tracking pedogenic carbonate formation and migration in agricultural soils amended with crushed wollastonite ore- Evidence from field trials,University of Guelph; University of Guelph; University of Guelph,"Considered as a well-known carbon sequestration method, terrestrial enhanced rock weathering involves the application of crushed silicate-bearing minerals to urban and agricultural soils. Once dissolved in the soil-water system, alkaline minerals adjust the pH in a range favorable for pedogenic carbonate formation and, hence, atmospheric carbon drawdown. As a fast-weathering Ca-rich mineral, wollastonite is recognized as one of the primary candidates for this process. Although previous studies proved the potential of wollastonite to sequester carbon in croplands, no study has investigated the fate of wollastonite over the vertical profile of soil. Furthermore, no studies have investigated changes in the elemental composition of soils due to wollastonite amendment on a field scale. The present study presents the results of a multi-year sampling collection from different layers (0‚Äì15, 15‚Äì30, and 30‚Äì60 cm) of agricultural soil amended with wollastonite in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada. The impact of initial soil pH on pedogenic carbonate formation was also investigated with the inclusion of two more field trials. The results denoted wollastonite addition increases the inorganic carbon pool of soil up to 6.60 t CO 2 /ha at higher (20 t/ha) wollastonite dosage. The elemental composition and mineralogy analyses were indicative of weathering occurrence in soil samples. This study indicates that carbonate formation is not limited to surficial layers, and deeper layers also need to be taken into account for estimating carbon capture due to ERW practice.",title,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.49,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.91,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.98,0.03,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3851689/v1,2,0,1,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,2,114,0,3,1,1

A major contributor to Malaysia‚Äôs CO2 emissions is coal-fired electricity power plants, responsible for 43.4% of the overall emissions. Malaysia‚Äôs forest soil offers organic sequestration of 15 tonnes of CO2 ha‚àí1¬∑year‚àí1. Unlike organic CO2 sequestration in soil, inorganic sequestration of CO2 through mineral carbonation, once formed, is considered as a permanent sink. Inorganic CO2 sequestration in Malaysia has not been extensively studied, and the country‚Äôs potential for using the technique for atmospheric CO2 removal is undefined. In addition, Malaysia produces a significant amount of solid waste annually and, of that, demolition concrete waste, basalt quarry fine, and fly and bottom ashes are calcium-rich materials suitable for inorganic CO2 sequestration. This project introduces a potential solution for sequestering atmospheric CO2 inorganically for Malaysia. If lands associated to future developments in Malaysia are designed for inorganic CO2 sequestration using demolition concrete waste, basalt quarry fine, and fly and bottom ashes, 597,465 tonnes of CO2 can be captured annually adding a potential annual economic benefit of ‚Ç¨4,700,000.",author,tech|10,meth|03,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.3390/geosciences8120483,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,6,0,0,1,1

The amendment was applied at 0, 1, 5, 25 and 50 t/ha to cover situations of moderate application rates to that where the amendment might be banded to produce high local concentrations. Having an abrasion pH of about 9, the amendment was able to reduce both active acidity (as estimated by an increase in soil pH) and reserve acidity (reduction in % Al saturation of the CEC). Increases in soil pH resulted in increased CEC, depending on the variable charge nature of each soil, accompanied by increases in exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K supplied by the basalt. The amounts of basic cations converted to exchangeable form constituted only a fraction of the amounts applied. Thus the cations held in reserve ensure that the effect of cation enrichment will be prolonged. In some soils phosphate sorption was significantly reduced by crushed basalt application. Furthermore, ‚Äòavailable‚Äô P as measured by extraction with 0.005 M H2SO4 was increased. These effects appear to be due to the release of silicate from the basalt as well as modest amounts of phosphate in the rock. Three extractants commonly used for estimating Si availability in sugarcane production indicated that all 7 soils contained sub-optimal levels of the element. Application of crushed basalt rock increased extractable Si levels above what is considered sufficient for this crop. The incubated soils were placed in columns and leached with the equivalent of 2750-mm (average wet season) rainfall. Re-analysis showed that the favourable chemical soil properties imparted by the amendment were retained. These results add further support to the contention that the effects of amelioration will continue for some time.",author,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.1,0.01,0.01,0.04,0.15,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.89,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.33,0.63,0.01,0.07,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0883-2927(02)00078-1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,26,0,0,0,1,1

The process takes advantage of the supply of carbonate ions derived from urea hydrolysis and of an increase in pH generated by the reaction, effects that in the presence of Ca2+ ions lead to the precipitation of CaCO3. Further to its importance in nature, if performed in a biomimetic manner, the urease-aided CaCO3 mineralization offers enormous potential in innovative engineering applications as an eco-friendly technique operative under mild conditions, to be used for remediation and cementation/deposition in field applications in situ. These include among others, the strengthening and consolidation of soil/sand, the protection and restoration of stone and concrete structures, conservation of stone cultural heritage materials, cleaning waste- and groundwater of toxic metals and radionuclides, and plugging geological formations for the enhancement of oil recovery and geologic CO2 sequestration. In view of the potential of this newly emerging interdisciplinary branch of engineering, this article presents the principles of urease-aided calcium carbonate mineralization apposed to other biomineralization processes, and reviews the advantages and limitations of the technique compared to the conventional techniques presently in use.

A review,"Institute for Research on Environment and Sustainability, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK","Recently published assessments of nutrient budgets on a national basis have shown that K deficits for developing countries are so substantial that a doubling of world production of potash fertilisers would be required to balance inputs and offtake, simply to meet demands in Africa alone. The price of potassium fertiliser raw materials has increased by a factor of 4 during 2007‚Äì2009, approaching $1000 per tonne in some markets. Thus an annual investment of the order of US$5600 million is required to replenish soil K stocks in Africa. In this context it is appropriate to review current knowledge of alternative sources of K, which is the seventh most abundant element in the Earth‚Äôs continental crust, present in feldspars and (much less commonly) feldspathoid minerals including nepheline and leucite. Theoretical considerations based on the experimental determination of mineral dissolution rates indicate that nepheline dissolves 100 times more quickly than potassium feldspar, and this suggests that nepheline-bearing rocks are more effective as sources of K for plant growth than granitic rocks, even though these have higher K contents. Crop trials with silicate rocks and minerals as sources of K show increased K availability and uptake for nepheline-bearing rocks compared with granitic rocks. Under conditions where soils are rapidly leached (especially tropical soils such as oxisols that contain quartz, aluminium oxy-hydroxides and kaolinite), with low capacity to retain soluble nutrients, the use of potassium feldspar or crushed granite does give a yield response, although no greater than for conventional fertilisers. In other experiments with crushed ultramafic, basaltic and andesitic rocks improvements in crop yield are claimed, although this cannot be unambiguously related to the mineralogical or chemical composition of the rock used. In conclusion, the present high cost of conventional potassium fertilisers justifies further investigation of potassium silicate minerals and their host rocks (which in some cases include basic rocks, such as basalt) as alternative sources of K, especially for systems with highly weathered soils that lack a significant cation exchange capacity. Such soils commonly occur in developing countries, and so this approach provides an opportunity to develop indigenous silicate rock sources of K as an alternative to sometimes prohibitively expensive commercial fertilisers.",doi,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.06,0.01,0.01,0.04,0.23,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.88,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.96,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.99,yes,https://doi.org/10.1051/agro/2009023,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,0,0,0,1,1

Manning,Mineral sources of potassium for plant nutrition,,"Recently published assessments of nutrient budgets on a national basis have shown that K deficits for developing countries are so substantial that a doubling of world production of potash fertilisers would be required to balance inputs and offtake, simply to meet demands in Africa alone. The price of potassium fertiliser raw materials has increased by a factor of 4 during 2007‚Äì2009, approaching $1000 per tonne in some markets. Thus an annual investment of the order of US$5600 million is required to replenish soil K stocks in Africa. In this context it is appropriate to review current knowledge of alternative sources of K, which is the seventh most abundant element in the Earth‚Äôs continental crust, present in feldspars and (much less commonly) feldspathoid minerals including nepheline and leucite. Theoretical considerations based on the experimental determination of mineral dissolution rates indicate that nepheline dissolves 100 times more quickly than potassium feldspar, and this suggests that nepheline-bearing rocks are more effective as sources of K for plant growth than granitic rocks, even though these have higher K contents. Crop trials with silicate rocks and minerals as sources of K show increased K availability and uptake for nepheline-bearing rocks compared with granitic rocks. Under conditions where soils are rapidly leached (especially tropical soils such as oxisols that contain quartz, aluminium oxy-hydroxides and kaolinite), with low capacity to retain soluble nutrients, the use of potassium feldspar or crushed granite does give a yield response, although no greater than for conventional fertilisers. In other experiments with crushed ultramafic, basaltic and andesitic rocks improvements in crop yield are claimed, although this cannot be unambiguously related to the mineralogical or chemical composition of the rock used. In conclusion, the present high cost of conventional potassium fertilisers justifies further investigation of potassium silicate minerals and their host rocks (which in some cases include basic rocks, such as basalt) as alternative sources of K, especially for systems with highly weathered soils that lack a significant cation exchange capacity. Such soils commonly occur in developing countries, and so this approach provides an opportunity to develop indigenous silicate rock sources of K as an alternative to sometimes prohibitively expensive commercial fertilisers.",title,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.06,0.01,0.01,0.04,0.2,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.04,0.88,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.04,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.91,0.01,0.0,0.02,0.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.99,yes,https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/184911,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

In Brazil, potassium fertilizers are mostly imported rising interest on rocks and mining rejects as alternative sources. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of crushed rocks over mineral nutrition, yield and efficiency of potash fertilization in rice. The experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions in pots with 3.7 kg of Oxisol soil samples. The experimental design was completely randomized, in a factorial layout 4 &times; 6, comprising six crushed rocks used as alternative multinutrient fertilizer (breccia, biotite schist, ultramafic, Chapada byproduct, mining byproduct and phlogopite), and four doses based on potassium (0, 200, 400, 600 kg K2O ha-1), with four replications. The concentration and accumulation of potassium, copper, zinc and nickel in rice shoot dry mass were determined. These data were used to evaluate the efficiency index of K-source rocks on fertilization. It was shown that crushed rocks promote alterations in mineral nutrition, grain yield and potassium use efficiency, remarking their potential to be used as alternative fertilizer in rice cropping systems. &nbsp; Key words: Alternative nutrient source, micronutrient, fertilization efficiency, plant nutrition, soil conditioner.",title,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.06,0.01,0.01,0.07,0.13,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.04,0.85,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.99,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.5897/ajar2013.6338,3,0,1,9,0,0,1,53,1,0,0,0,26,0,1,1

Carbon sequestration in phytoliths is regarded as a highly stable carbon sink mechanism in terrestrial ecosystems to mitigate climate change. However, the response of plant phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC) to external silicon amendments remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of basalt powder (BP) amendment on phytolith carbon sequestration in rice (Oryza sativa), a high-PhytOC accumulator. The results showed that the contents of phytolith and PhytOC in rice increased with BP amendment. The PhytOC production flux in different rice plant parts varied considerably (0.005‚Äì0.041 Mg CO2 ha‚àí1 a‚àí1), with the highest flux in the sheath. BP amendment can significantly enhance flux of phytolith carbon sequestration in croplands by 150%. If the global rice cultivation of 1.55 √ó 108 ha had a similar flux of PhytOC production in this study, 0.61 √ó 107 to 1.54 √ó 107 Mg CO2 would be occluded annually within global rice phytoliths.

Seventeen years after reforestation and seven years after canopy closure, strong gradients with soil depth were found regarding soil bulk density, pH and carbon storage.

These effects could be due to the shift in microbial metabolism and/or modification of microbial habitats. At the system level, soil microorganisms play an integral role in virtually all ecosystem processes. There is a growing interest to reveal the underlying mechanisms of slag-microbe interactions and the contribution of soil biota to ecosystem functioning. In this perspective, we discuss the possible driving mechanisms of slag-microbe interactions in soil and how these slag-microbe interactions can affect crop yield, greenhouse gas emissions, soil carbon sequestration, and heavy metal stabilization in contaminated soils. In addition, we discuss the problems and environmental concerns in using slag in agriculture. Emphasis has been given for further research to validate the proposed mechanisms associated with slag-microbe interactions for increasing soil quality, crop productivity and mitigating environmental consequences. While evaluating the slag amendment effects on agriculture and environment, the potential risks, socio-economics, techno-economics and ethics should be assessed.",doi,tech|04,meth|05,cont|5,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.86,0.02,0.04,0.01,0.02,0.07,0.56,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.93,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.99,yes,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01320,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,1

The balance between biotic and abiotic processes determines the fluxes of bioavailable silicon (Si), impacting plant growth and health, and diatoms biomass, hence the oceanic capacity to fix carbon dioxide. Here we quantified this balance in an experimental system using rice and an albic soil material (quartz grains) containing no weatherable silicate minerals. Materials representing a soil weathering gradient were prepared by adding variable amounts of silicate minerals within fresh powdered tephrite (<83 ¬µm) as a source of weatherable minerals whereas phytogenic Si was supplied within phytolith-rich biochar. We quantified the distribution of Si in leachate, soil and plant reservoirs. Weatherable minerals rapidly released Si that flowed into two main sinks: allophanic substances neoformed in soil from released Si and aluminum (Al), and phytoliths formed by precipitation of absorbed silica in plant tissues. The leaching of Si was negligible. Allophane rapidly formed at a maximum rate of 0.85 g allophane kg‚àí1 soil day‚àí1. Of the Si stock of weatherable minerals, 7‚Äì14% contributed to allophanic Si and less than 1% to phytogenic Si. The contribution of supplied phytoliths to plant Si accumulation markedly increased from 26 to 80% with the decrease in weatherable mineral reserve from 405 to 5 cmolc kg‚àí1. Weatherable minerals primarily controlled bioavailable Si while phytoliths increasingly contributed to Si plant uptake with increasing mineral depletion. Returning phytoliths to soil thus boosts the biological recycling of Si in proportion to the increase in soil weathering stage.",doi,tech|09,meth|01,cont|5,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.39,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.77,0.57,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.04,0.98,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114308,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,1

Nine fertilisation treatments were applied: three doses of sewage sludge (160, 320, and 480 kg total N ha‚àí1) or no fertilisation, all with or without liming, and mineral fertiliser with no liming. Soil pH decreased over time due to cations extraction by trees and pine needles deposited in the understory. Tree growth increased light interception, decreasing soil carbon incorporation. The interannual variation of carbon also depended on weather conditions. Initially, fertilisation increased soil pH and carbon, but without compensating cations extraction over time. Therefore, it is advisable to apply amendments in the middle years of the plantation. Tree management is also needed to decrease competitiveness and enhance carbon incorporation.

This is particularly the case for highly weathered soils in tropical countries, where classical soluble fertilizers are often not affordable or not accessible. One way to replenish macro- and micronutrients are ground silicate rock powders (SRPs). Rock forming silicate minerals contain most nutrients essential for higher plants, yet slow and inconsistent weathering rates have restricted their use in the past. Recent findings, however, challenge past agronomic objections which insufficiently addressed the factorial complexity of the weathering process. This review therefore first presents a framework with the most relevant factors for the weathering of SRPs through which several outcomes of prior studies can be explained. A subsequent analysis of 48 crop trials reveals the potential as alternative K source and multi-nutrient soil amendment for tropical soils, whereas the benefits for temperate soils are currently inconclusive. Beneficial results prevail for mafic and ultramafic rocks like basalts and rocks containing nepheline or glauconite. Several rock modifications are highly efficient in increasing the agronomic effectiveness of SRPs. Enhanced weathering of SRPs could additionally sequester substantial amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere and silicon (Si) supply can induce a broad spectrum of plant biotic and abiotic stress resistance. Recycling massive amounts of rock residues from domestic mining industries could furthermore resolve serious disposal challenges and improve fertilizer self-sufficiency. In conclusion, under the right circumstances, SRPs could not only advance low-cost and regional soil sustaining crop production but contribute to various sustainable development goals.",doi,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,yes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150976,11,0,0,2,0,5,12,0,4,0,28,7,5,4,1,1

This poses a global challenge to minimise environmental impacts from intensified production and use of chemical fertilisers. The study investigates whether basalt rock dust fertiliser can be an environmentally sustainable close substitute to expensive conventional rock-derived P and K fertilisers. Method The study uses the attributional life cycle assessment method to estimate and compare 15 environmental impacts between basalt rock dust fertiliser, a potential source of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), and five widely used industrial P and K fertilisers. In addition, we model hypothetical basalt substitution rates for PK fertilisers to highlight potential ecological savings in terms of carbon capture.

Traditional measurements that allow quantification of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in laboratory ERW tests include chemical analyses of the leached out soil water and monitoring with electronic pH and EC soil sensors. Unfortunately, application of these methods on our ERW field experiments has not given us any results, and it seems that it may take several more years for a relevant ERW signal to emerge. As an alternative quantification method, we used CO‚ÇÇ sensors placed inside the soil in combination with automated CO‚ÇÇ flux meters on top of the soil as a new way to assess the CDR effects resulting from ERW treatments in agricultural settings. This novel approach could provide a faster way to assess the effectiveness of ERW in removing CO‚ÇÇ from the atmosphere. And in turn, this would expedite ERW experiments as it could make large-scale/multi-variant experiments feasible and eventually become a new methodology for MRV (monitoring, reporting and verification) of ERW. This approach may also enable a faster collection of the large datasets that are needed for the creation, calibration and validation of accurate ERW models.",,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.04,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.18,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.82,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.05,0.01,0.78,0.01,0.0,0.03,0.01,0.1,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.31223/x5267r,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, USA","Reershemius and Suhrhoff (2023) have identified some concerns with Kantola et al. (2023). We wish to point out that Reershemius and Suhrhoff find no fault with the derivation in the paper (equations 3‚Äì6), which are factually true by inspection. Reershemius and Suhrhoff are focused in their letter on implementation details that, in their words, ‚Äúdo not necessarily detract‚Äù from the study's final outcomes. In fact, these same authors arrive at more or less an identical result in their own unpublished work for the identical experimental plots. This should not be surprising, because their work takes a substantially similar approach to estimating mass fluxes of cations in the soil using immobile trace elements to constrain mineral application rates. Far from being ‚Äúunusable without significant alterations,‚Äù we will show that the issues they identify lack merit. Nonetheless, the authors of this response appreciate the constructive engagement on this exciting scientific frontier, and we appreciate the convictions of Reershemius and Suhrhoff for clear data transparency. Reershemius and Suhrhoff are arguing that a mass balance approach should be taken to constrain elemental budgets in the soil layer, that is to use massbasalt and masssoil and not simply the concentrations [REE]basalt and [REE]soil. We do not disagree: Our paper plainly states in the paragraph following equation 3: ‚ÄúThe calculated slope difference (kg rock kg‚àí1 soil) was converted to kg rock m‚àí3 units by using estimates of the soil bulk density. [‚Ä¶] The total sampling depth of 30 cm was used to ultimately convert the rock application rate units to kg rock m‚àí2 units.‚Äù Reershemius and Suhrhoff can find a worked example making use of these parameters in the appendix 2 spreadsheet, tab ‚ÄúFull Analysis‚ÄîBasalt,‚Äù cells AF24:33. Reershemius and Suhrhoff are arguing that the untreated plots should be interpreted as a background or baseline signal, and that this signal should be added back into the treated plots. Because the untreated plots show losses of elements, subtracting this negative baseline would have the effect of increasing the estimated rate of carbon removal. We do not share this interpretation. First, the untreated plot is not a ceteris paribus comparison with the treated plot, because the dissolution of the mineral changes the pH of the soil, and the change in pH has a known and clear impact on elemental fluxes. Stated differently: The untreated control is more acidic and is fully expected to have greater leaching than an identical soil with higher pH. Second, these experiments are carried out in a social context in which lower carbon intensity for farms is a desired outcome; it has value. Subtracting this negative baseline would have the effect of increasing the estimated carbon removal, thus enhancing the claims. Thus, in addition to the mechanistic rationale, it is more conservative from a carbon accounting perspective to not subtract the non-equivalent baseline. Reershemius and Suhrhoff are arguing that the choice of immobile tracers is subjective. However, Reershemius and Suhrhoff themselves (their figure 1a) show that selection of HREE versus all REEs only changes the slope of ŒîREEsoil versus rock REErock from 0.0409 to 0.0401, a slope difference of just 2%. The synthetic results in figure 1c,d make use of the untreated plots as a baseline to which they add modeled rock dust for dissolution. As discussed above, these untreated plots are not a proxy for the treated plots but for the addition of the rock: They are a distinct geochemical system, with different boundary conditions, and the addition of the rock changes the boundary conditions in meaningful ways, including pH, and cation exchange dynamics. These plots are perhaps interesting to illustrate how a toy model differs from reality, but they are not useful as an alternate reality to the empirical evidence that was actually presented.

This technology relies on accelerating the natural process of mineral weathering in soils by manipulating the abiotic variables that govern this process, in particular mineral grain size and exposure to acids dissolved in water. EW mainly aims at reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations by enhancing inorganic carbon sequestration. Until now, knowledge of EW has been mainly gained through experiments that focused on the abiotic variables known for stimulating mineral weathering, thereby neglecting the potential influence of biotic components. While bacteria, fungi, and earthworms are known to increase mineral weathering rates, the use of soil organisms in the context of EW remains underexplored. This protocol describes the design and construction of an experimental setup developed to enhance mineral weathering rates through soil organisms while concurrently controlling abiotic conditions. The setup is designed to maximize weathering rates while maintaining soil organisms' activity. It consists of a large number of columns filled with rock powder and organic material, located in a climate chamber and with water applied via a downflow irrigation system. Columns are placed above a fridge containing jerrycans to collect the leachate. Representative results demonstrate that this setup is suitable to ensure the activity of soil organisms and quantify their effect on inorganic carbon sequestration. Challenges remain in minimizing leachate losses, ensuring homogeneous ventilation through the climate chamber, and avoiding flooding of the columns. With this setup, an innovative and promising approach is proposed to enhance mineral weathering rates through the activity of soil biota and disentangle the effect of biotic and abiotic factors as drivers of EW.",,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.49,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.85,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.1,0.93,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.3791/65563-v,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

If widely adopted on farmlands, it could help achieve net-zero or negative emissions by 2050. We report detailed state-level analysis indicating EW deployed on agricultural land could sequester 0.23-0.38 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$ and meet 36-60 % of U.S. technological CDR goals. Average CDR costs vary between state, being highest in the first decades before declining to a range of $\sim\$$100-150 tCO$_2{}^{-1}$ by 2050, including for three states (Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana) that contribute most to total national CDR. We identify multiple electoral swing states as being essential for scaling EW that are also key beneficiaries of the practice, indicating the need for strong bipartisan support of this technology. Assessment the geochemical capacity of rivers and oceans to carry dissolved EW products from soil drainage suggests EW provides secure long-term CO$_2$ removal on intergenerational time scales. We additionally forecast mitigation of ground-level ozone increases expected with future climate change, as an indirect benefit of EW, and consequent avoidance of yield reductions.

In this study, weathering experiments exposed brucite, wollastonite skarn, serpentinite, and kimberlite residues (Venetia Diamond Mine, South Africa), to wetting and drying cycles (4/day) for 1 yr to elucidate reaction pathways and rates while evaluating carbon verification tools, including mineral quantification, total inorganic carbon (TIC), and stable and radiogenic carbon isotopes. Two primary reaction pathways were identified: A) silicate and hydroxide dissolution leading to carbonate precipitation (desirable), and B) dissolution and reprecipitation of carbonates (undesirable). The kimberlite residues, containing serpentine (19‚Äì33 wt%) and calcite (4‚Äì5 wt%), experienced variable and minor changes in total inorganic carbon. The Œ¥13C and Œ¥18O values of the carbonate minerals approached those expected for atmospheric-derived CO2 and are best explained by the exchange of carbonate CO2 with atmospheric CO2 (pathway A) as opposed to net CO2 sequestration. In contrast, the reaction of brucite (1.22% to 5.98%) and wollastonite skarn (0.22% to 1.01%) with atmospheric CO2 was substantial, as indicated by the increases in TIC (pathway B) yet decreases in Œ¥13C values were inconsistent with the incorporation of atmospheric CO2 as a result of kinetic isotope fractionation due to carbonation being CO2 supply limited. The pulverized serpentinite experience insufficient carbonation to be detected by TIC. Unweathered (blue ground) and naturally weathered (yellow ground) kimberlite from the Voorspoed Diamond Mine, South Africa were compared to kimberlite residues used in experiments. Yellow ground contained twice the TIC content compared to blue ground whereas quantitative scanning electron microscopy revealed calcite veinlets that are characteristic of secondary mineralization.

However, due to climatic variability and field data limitations, uncertainties remain regarding the influence of ERW on food security and soil carbon pools in temperate regions. This study focused to evaluate the crop productivity and carbon sequestration potential of farmland ERW in China by conducting field monitoring in different humid regions and ERW performance model. Additionally, the contribution of climate, soil, and management factors to ERW-mediated yield and carbon sequestration changes was explored using random forest and correlation networks. Field monitoring indicated that farmland ERW significantly improved crop yield in humid region (13.5 ¬± 5.2 %), along with notable improvements in soil pH and available nutrients. Precipitation (10.4‚Äì16.7 %) and soil pH (9.7‚Äì16.8 %) had the highest contribution on ERW mediated yield and carbon sequestration changes, but the contribution of management factors (24‚Äì26.2 %), especially N input (2.7‚Äì7.0 %), should not be disregarded. The model evaluation demonstrated that the carbon sequestration rate of farmland ERW in China can reach 0.28‚Äì0.40 Gt yr‚àí1, thereby presenting an opportunity to expand and accelerate the nationally determined contributions of China. The mean sequestration cost of farmland ERW was 633 ¬± 161 CNY ¬• t-CO2‚àí1, which was an attractive sequestration price considering the positive benefits of rock powder on soil pH and nutrients. Deploying ERW in acidified and mineral nutrient deficient regions was able to serve as an alternative to lime and part chemical fertilizers to improve yield and maximize agricultural sustainability and resource co-benefits. Farmland ERW also has the potential to resource silicate waste to assist traditional, difficult-to-decarbonize industries to reduce carbon emissions.

Using an integrated carbon cycle, climate and energy system model, we show that applying basalt to forests could triple the level of carbon sequestration induced by EW compared to an application restricted to croplands. EW reduces the costs of achieving the Paris Agreement targets, and alleviates the pressure on food prices by reducing the willingness to pay for bioenergy; however, it does not significantly reduce the use of BECCS, which remains a major cost-effective mitigation option.

However, unintended biogeochemical interactions with the nitrogen cycle may arise through ERW increasing soil pH as basalt grains undergo dissolution that may reinforce, counteract, or even offset the climate benefits from carbon sequestration. Increases in soil pH could drive changes in the soil emissions of key non-CO2 greenhouse gases, e.g., nitrous oxide (N2O), and trace gases, e.g., nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) that affect air quality, and crop and human health. We present the development and implementation of a new improved nitrogen cycling scheme for the land surface model Community Land Model v5 (CLM5), the land component of the Community Earth System Model, allowing evaluation of ERW effects on soil gas emissions. We base the new parameterizations on datasets derived from soil pH responses of N2O, NO and NH3 of ERW field trial and mesocosm experiments with crushed basalt. We successfully validated simulated &lsquo;control&rsquo; (i.e., no ERW) seasonal cycles of soil N2O, NO and NH3 emissions against a wide range of global emission inventories. We benchmark simulated mitigation of soil N2O fluxes in response to ERW against a sub-set of data from ERW field trials in the U.S. Corn Belt. Using the new scheme, we provide a specific example of the effect of large-scale ERW deployment with croplands on soil nitrogen fluxes across five key regions with high potential for CDR with ERW (North America, Brazil, Europe, India, and China). Across these regions, ERW implementation led to marked reductions in N2O and NO (both 18 %) with moderate increases in NH3 (2 %). Our improved N-cycle scheme within CLM5 has utility for investigating the potential of ERW point-source and regional effects of soil N2O, NO and NH3 fluxes in response to current and future climates.

Previous estimates have suggested that enhanced silicate weathering (EW) has the potential to remove significant quantities of CO2, as much as 6‚Äì30 Mt CO2 yr‚àí1 for the UK. However, if secondary carbonates are precipitated during the riverine transport of the products of EW, a portion of this CO2 will be re-released, lowering the net carbon dioxide removal (CDR) potential of the mitigation strategy. Here, we assess the fluvial response to EW in the UK by calculating the expected riverine carbonate precipitation due to the dissolution of 10‚Äì50 t ha‚àí1 yr‚àí1 of silicate rock on available arable cropland in major UK catchments.Increases in calcite saturation due to the export of soluble cations sourced from EW from soil to rivers are simulated to cross thresholds for spontaneous carbonate precipitation in several major UK river catchments (e.g. the Great Ouse, Thames). Catchments most susceptible to potential secondary carbonate precipitation are those with a high ratio of cropland to water discharge. On average, carbonate precipitation for major UK catchments is expected to make EW 16% (10 t ha‚àí1), 21% (20 t ha‚àí1) or 27% (50 t ha‚àí1) less effective at removing CO2 than that predicted in the absence of such precipitation. Furthermore, when placing strict silica limitations on weathering reactions within soils, the CDR potential of EW is reduced considerably, to 0.23 Mt CO2 yr‚àí1.Although reducing the CDR potential of EW, we suggest that under rapid weathering conditions, carbonate precipitation in UK rivers will prevent pH increases over the safe level for freshwater ecosystems (pH > 9).

Geologically permanent sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in carbonate minerals-carbon mineralization-requires two moles of alkalinity and one mole of a CO2-reactive metal such as calcium or magnesium per mole of CO2 captured. Chemical weathering of geological materials can supply both ingredients, but weathering reactions must be accelerated to achieve targets for durable CDR. Here, a scalable CDR and mineralization process is reported in which water electrolysis is used to produce sulfuric acid for accelerated weathering, while a base is used to permanently sequester CO2 from air into carbonate minerals. The process can be integrated into existing extractive processes by reacting produced sulfuric acid with critical element feedstocks that neutralize acidity (e.g., rock phosphorus or ultramafic rock mine tailings), with calcium- and magnesium-bearing sulfate wastes electrolytically upcycled. The highest reported efficiency of electrolytic sulfuric acid production is achieved by maintaining catholyte feed conditions that minimize Faradaic losses by hydroxide permeation of the membrane-separated electrochemical cell.

Among them, Enhanced Weathering (EW) is regarded as one of the most promising. This consists of amending soils with silicate minerals, such as olivine, so as to speed up the weathering process that naturally occurs in soils. This work aims to couple a model for the resolution of the agro-hydrological balance in the active soil layer of croplands (i.e., WATNEEDS model) and a dynamic mass balance model that explores ecohydrological, biogeochemical, and olivine dissolution dynamics, also estimating carbon sequestration rates (i.e., EW model). This latter is composed of different interacting components and takes into account important processes, such as the cation exchange.From the operational point of view, the EW model is fed by rainfall data, and the outputs of the soil water balance (i.e., infiltration, evapotranspiration, leaching, and runoff rates) estimated by the WATNEEDS at the global scale at a 5 arcminute resolution. In this study, a regional application of both models is proposed to explore EW efficiency in various cropland areas in Sicily (Italy), the largest island of the Mediterranean basin, which is considered a hot spot of climate change. The methodological approach will be developed and tested for four different crops (i.e., olive and citrus groves, vineyards, and fruit trees) that are particularly widespread and profitable in the selected region. Apart from facing climate change, the goal of this study is also to preserve water, thus selecting the most suitable irrigation strategies in the context of a changing climate and olivine amendment prescription.

ESW involves applying pulverized silicates to increase reactive mineral surfaces which in turn may speed-up the weathering and scale to aid in global CO2 removal. However, current studies supporting ESW has been relying on theoretical estimates and short-term laboratory experiments whose results are difficult to extrapolate to the field. Also, many studies have focused on inorganic C chemistry while soil is a rich medium that mediates a multitude of chemical and biological processes, many of which are not well studied but may play an important role in controlling ESW. To address this gap, the Working Lands Innovation Center (WLIC) Project was launched in 2019 for a field scale test, and three commercial amendments (compost, biochar, and silicate powder&amp;#8212;meta-basalt) have been applied yearly with a full factorial design in a 2.07 ha corn field at the Campbell Tract research facility located on the UC Davis campus. My project within WLIC evaluates the impact of ESW on soil surface C pools related to microbial processes and its potential synergies with traditional organic amendments. We hypothesized that co-applying organic amendments plus pulverized silicate minerals will: 1) increase microbial biomass with distinct microbial community composition; and 2) increase the formation of stable carbon pools (e.g., mineral associated organic matter) relative to only silicate applied soil. To test this, we sampled soils from all possible amendment combinations at pre-, and post-harvesting seasons in 2021 and 2022. We completed a suite of analyses to monitor temporal changes of soil chemistry, multiple C pool sizes, and microbial parameters.

Several silicate-rich minerals (e.g., basalt, olivine, and wollastonite) have been a matter of particular interest of researchers investigating the applicability of this approach for sequestrating atmospheric CO2 in agricultural and urban soils. Several field-scale and laboratory-scale experiments have been conducted in our research group investigating the impact of the wollastonite amendment on the agricultural soil of Ontario. This includes monitoring pedogenic carbonate formation and migration in soil and subsoil systems (through collecting shallow and deep samples down to 1-meter profiles) as well as the effect on various plant growths in soils amended with crushed wollastonite.The water (e.g., rainfall or irrigation water) infiltrating the porous medium of soil could transport and relocate solid particles over the vertical profile of the soil. Accordingly, when crushed silicate minerals (e.g., wollastonite) is applied to topsoil, the recurring introduction of water leads to the dissolution of mineral as well as downward migration of weathering products which could be settled in subsoil layers. Furthermore, the dissolution of wollastonite alters the chemical properties (e.g., pH, EC, etc.) of migrating water, which finally find its way to the water table below the soil medium. In the present study, we have looked into evidence of the vertical distribution of weathering products in soils amended with crushed wollastonite, whose relatively rapid weathering rate helps in the shorter-term to inform what occurs in the longer-term with slower weathering minerals. The experimental setup includes soil columns with and without wollastonite enrichment, located under two situations of lab environment (with regular hand-operated irrigation) and outdoor (with natural rainfall-fed). We also investigated the leachate collected from the bottom of columns in term of physiochemical properties.The current study is part of the analytical and modelling framework we are developing in order to account for newly formed pedogenic carbonate as a qualified implementation for carbon capture credits. Such verified methods would encourage private and governmental entities to contribute to meeting emissions reduction goals and encourage the adoption of enhanced rock weathering as a reliable negative emissions technology.",,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.34,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.9,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.62,0.39,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-17289,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

During silicate rock weathering, dissolved carbon dioxide in the form of carbonic acid, reacts with rock minerals to form stable soil pore water bicarbonate or soil calcium carbonate. The carbon dioxide removal potential of enhanced weathering has been successfully demonstrated in short-term lab and mesocosm studies. Due to the transient nature of bicarbonate in the aqueous soil solution, in-field quantification of the carbon dioxide sequestered is tedious, labour-intense and poorly scalable for the verification of carbon credits. Various methods have been suggested in order to quantify the amount of carbon dioxide sequestered through rock weathering. This quantification is essential for verification bodies to award carbon credits. Although various methods have been proposed to demonstrate that in-field weathering is occurring, there is still no consensus for a scalable, profitable solution. In recent years, an increasing number of field trials have seen the light of day. However, large uncertainties about in-field weathering rates and the influence of natural environmental variability, such as drought and vaying temperatures, still exist.&amp;#160; In this study we focus on two proxies affected by the weathering process, namely pH and EC. We compare field measurements of pH and EC from both in-situ sensors and extracted soil pore water with model predictions from a 1D-reactive transport model.

Such a formidable challenge requires an urgent assessment of all possible routes to CDR, as further delayed mitigation will have an increasingly damaging effect on the environment. The challenge is pertinent to industrial sectors which produce several Gt of CO2 per year and are susceptible to financial impacts due to nascent carbon taxes worldwide, and other negative environmental impacts brought on by the generation of vast amounts of solid and liquid waste materials (e.g., rock cuttings and overburden, fine mine tailings, glassy slags, fly ashes and desalination reject brines). Geochemical CDR strategies in such industrial wastes, where the natural process of rock weathering and carbonate precipitation is utilised to uptake CO2, is a potentially significant CDR approach for bicarbonate (alkalinity) and carbonate generation, requiring material assessment and enhancement schemes to fully realise the high removal potential.The DETAILS project (Developing enhanced weathering methods in mine tailings for CO2 sequestration; Marie Sk&amp;#322;odowska-Curie grant agreement ID: 101018312) is exploring the CO2-water-solid waste material reactivity of a range of mine tailings, slags and fly ashes, sourced from industrial centres globally. The range of materials includes those considered to be chemically and mineralogically promising for CDR (e.g., mine tailings derived from olivine dunite, Ni sulphide and diamond kimberlite operations, carbonate marble fines), materials with limited or unknown CDR potential (e.g., Al-bauxite-related red muds, borate tailings, ilmenite tailings, products from SO2 processing, copper smelting produced slags and combustion fly ashes), and materials generally considered unfavourable (e.g., Cu and fluorite tailings). For all materials, the key to CDR strategy utilisation is the ability of favourable minerals to undergo significant dissolution for alkalinity generation and possible subsequent carbonation, on appropriate human timescales (e.g., seconds up to decadal), either naturally or through achieving enhanced rates of dissolution and precipitation.Changes to water chemistry through reactions with CO2 and powdered material samples were monitored throughout the experiment. These include changes to pH, alkalinity, silica, Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations, (Mg-Ca cations required for reactions with CO2 to produce stabilised bicarbonate and carbonate ions). Preliminary results reveal that Mg- and Ca-bearing minerals within some wastes react with CO2 to form alkalinity, suggesting potential for CDR strategies. Methods to increase reaction rates will be explored, such as a microbially-induced pH switch to increase the kinetics of mineral dissolution and mineral carbonation (e.g., oxidation and reduction reactions associated with microbial metabolisms active in sulphur and nitrogen cycling). A better understanding of reaction kinetics for a wider range of industrial wastes will help future projects to confirm or re-consider the viability of materials for CDR strategies, and to better identify opportunities for upscaled pilot schemes with further implemented geochemical CDR methods to speed up reaction kinetics.",,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.12,0.01,0.02,0.06,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.81,0.06,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.08,0.01,0.01,0.11,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.82,0.01,0.0,0.02,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.98,,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-384,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

One obvious application area would be seawater. Because weathering is a chemical reaction, it is influenced by environmental properties like temperature and physical properties like the reaction area.This study looks into the variability in sequestration rates from spreading of olivine at 13 distinct regional coasts around the world, including those with warm and temperate climates. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was performed with various combinations of influencing parameters (grain size and seawater temperature) to determine the effects of individual parameter combinations. A 100-year simulation was conducted using geochemical thermodynamic equilibrium modeling (PHREEQC).According to the simulations, over a 100-year period, CO2 uptake from atmosphere varies significantly between the seas, ranging from 0.13 (Black Sea) to 0.94 (Banda Sea) tonne (t) CO2 per t of olivine at a grain size of 100 &amp;#956;m. The difference between warm and temperate region&amp;#8217;s atmospheric CO2 uptake is 0.4 t CO2 per tonne of olivine dissolve in seawater. A subsequent sensitivity study of parameter combinations reveals that the Black Sea can reach 0.8 t CO2 consumption rates per tonne of olivine if the material was ground to a grain size of 19 &amp;#956;m while the Banda Sea can reach the same amount of consumption rates at a grain size of 150 &amp;#956;m.

However, it is still not clear which factors could maximize ESW rates. Previous studies have shown the potential of soil biota to amplify mineral weathering rates. Among the relevant soil biota are earthworms, which have been found to enhance nutrient release from soil minerals. This is indicative of their ability to increase weathering rates and further inorganic carbon (C) sequestration. Here we aim to accelerate ESW rates in a bio-reactor through earthworm activity. First, we identified the optimal conditions for earthworm survival and activity in an environment exclusively composed of ground silicate rocks and organic substrate. Second, we determined to what extent earthworms can enhance inorganic C sequestration in such a system. We carried out 5 rounds of 2-month experiments in a climate chamber at 25&amp;#176;C. The set-up of the experiments consisted of 200 columns, each topped by a sprinkler connected to an irrigation system, which allowed for different water irrigation rates and watering frequencies. The leachate of each column was collected in a jerrycan kept at 4&amp;#730;C. Within this set-up, we used two endogeic earthworm species (Aporrectodea Caliginosa and Allobophora Chlorotica) at different densities (10, 20, and 30 earthworms kg-1 soil), three types of rock flours (Basalt, Lava and Dunite) of two grain sizes (0.063 and 1.5 mm), one organic source (straw) and two water irrigation rates (125 and 250 ml day-1 kg-1 soil) at three watering frequencies (1, 2 and 5 times/day). Rock flours were used not only as single type or single size, but also as mixtures of types and/or sizes. At the end of each experiment, we measured earthworm survival and activity, and inorganic C sequestration rates by summing cumulative dissolved inorganic C in the leachate and the newly formed solid inorganic C content. We found no differences in survival and activity between the two earthworm species, but we did find an optimum for both parameters at a density of 10 earthworms kg-1 soil. Earthworms showed a clear preference for a mixture of grain sizes compared to single size, and for single mineral type compared to a mixture of mineral types. The response of earthworm survival and activity to the two water irrigation rates was similar, but at a water irrigation rate of 250 ml day-1 kg-1 soil a frequency of 5 times/day resulted in higher activity. Preliminary results indicate that earthworms increase mineral weathering rates and thereby sequester inorganic C.

To address this, we use the first large-scale field trial of ERW combined with tree planting at an afforestation experiment in mid-Wales. A factorial experimental design will enable us to determine the influence of basalt application and tree functional type on rock weathering and nutrient cycling parameters, such as soil pore water pH, alkalinity, cation concentrations and soil carbon.

South Africa","South Africa has the potential to be a global leader in implementing strategies targeting geochemical carbon dioxide removal (CDR) using mine tailings, utilising methods for alkalinity production and mineral carbonation. This is due to the hundreds of millions of tonnes of geochemically and mineralogically suitable tailings produced annually from diamond, PGM, chrome, nickel, phosphate, copper, talc and magnesite mines, exploiting mafic and ultramafic rocks. This approach may offer an additional route towards emissions offsets and reduction targets for South Africa. Here, a catalogue of tailings has been developed to highlight overall national CDR potential, drawing attention to site opportunities for pilot schemes. It has been calculated, using bulk geochemistry and shrinking core modelling, that South Africa has an average 1.1-1.7 MtCO2 removal capacity per year across all suitable sites, while an additional 11-17 MtCO2 could be removed through weathering historic tailings. The total CDR that could be achieved over the 2030-2100 period, considering all annually produced tailings available to weather, is 79-119 MtCO2. The capacity may be higher if mines of limited production information are considered, and pre-2017 tailings production amounts, abandoned stockpiles, and other industrial by-products are included. Diamond mines hold the highest geochemical CDR capacities, along with high tailings producers in Phalaborwa, Nkomati and Mogalakwena metal mines.

Earlier studies have modelled two reactor types, namely trickle-bed reactor and packed bubble column. However, their CO2 removal potential has not been compared. Building on the previous studies, this work further develops the mechanistic reactor models to enable them to consistently describe continuous weathering of minerals using seawater. Addressing the computational demands of the mechanistic models, a surrogate modelling-based optimisation procedure is developed to allow each reactor type to be rigorously optimised for minimising two competing objectives, namely energy consumption and space requirement. This has allowed the Pareto fronts of the two reactor types to be produced and compared. When applied to calcite weathering which is predominantly controlled by gas‚Äìliquid mass transfer, the packed-bubble column has been shown to consistently outperform the trickle-bed reactor, thanks to its superior mass transfer performance.

We evaluated 36 NETPs configurations considering their technical maturity, economic feasibility, greenhouse gas removal potential, resource use, and environmental impacts. We found multiple trade-offs among these indicators, which suggests that a regionalised portfolio of NETPs exploiting their complementary strengths is the way forward. Although no single NETP is superior to the others in terms of all the indicators simultaneously, we identified 16 Pareto-efficient NETPs. Among them, six are deemed particularly promising: forestation, soil carbon sequestration (SCS), enhanced weathering with olivine and three modalities of direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). While the co-benefits, lower costs and higher maturity levels of forestation and SCS can propel their rapid deployment, these NETPs require continuous monitoring to reduce unintended side-effects‚Äîmost notably the release of the stored carbon. Enhanced weathering also shows an overall good performance and substantial co-benefits, but its risks‚Äîespecially those concerning human health‚Äîshould be further investigated prior to deployment. DACCS presents significantly fewer side-effects, mainly its substantial energy demand; early investments in this NETP could reduce costs and accelerate its scale-up.

Enhanced weathering (EW) is a NET with considerable carbon sequestration potential. It is based on accelerated chemical reactions between alkaline minerals and water and carbon dioxide to generate bicarbonates in runoff that flows into the ocean to achieve long-term carbon sequestration. EW also presents a potential valorisation pathway for the use of industrial residues. Therefore, we selected non-hazardous industrial wastes (NHIWs) as the alkaline mineral of EW. The processes for implementing EW (crushing, transporting, and spreading NHIWs) will produce additional CO2 emissions and require energy input, and these values may vary in the life cycle of the specific facilities. To address this gap, we developed a multi-period mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to optimize NHIWs flows between sources and sinks over the planning horizon, while considering the annual CO2 sequestration target for achieving regional carbon drawdown. Our results show that the unit net CO2 sequestration cost for removing 1% and 1.5% annual carbon emissions of Shandong province is $273 and $378 /t CO2, respectively. It is estimated that from 2020 to 2030, the maximum CO2 sequestration of NHIWs produced by Shandong province will be 305.78 Mt CO2.

Amongst them, enhanced weathering (EW) of silicate minerals is a promising negative emission technology that can be associated with multiple co-benefits for crop production by spreading silicate minerals on arable soils (i.e. increase in crop yields, restoration of soil base cations and micro- and macronutrient stocks). A growing number of EW studies are focused on soil C sequestration and the effects on crop production. Yet, little is known about the impact of such management practices on GHG sink/source behaviour of agricultural soils and the soil bacterial communities involved.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this context, winter wheat (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Triticum aestivum&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;) was grown in 20 mesocosms undergoing 4 different treatments: acid soil (pH ~5) with or without basalt addition (50 tones ha&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) and alkaline soil (pH ~7) with or without basalt addition. Soil GHG emissions (CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, CH&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; and N&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;O) were measured at six different time points spread over the growing season (from March to June). Measurements included anaerobic conditions (i.e. immediately after irrigation events) and aerobic condition (i.e. in-between events). Simultaneously, soil was sampled for the study of the soil bacterial community.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We found that basalt application led to an increase in crop yield in acid soils, while it decreased the yield in alkaline soils. GHG emissions were not reduced by the basalt amendment. Soil CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2 &amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;fluxes peaked in-between irrigation events and were mainly influenced by the soil pH, being 2-fold higher in alkaline soils than in acid ones. Irrigation events increased both CH&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; and N&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;O fluxes.

While it was hypothesised that higher pH would result in an improved denitrification completion, the increase in pH induced by basalt application did not reduce soil N&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;O fluxes. Higher N&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;O fluxes were observed during irrigation events and in basalt-enriched mesocosms, as a result of combined enhanced nitrification and denitrification processes.

Enhanced Silicate Weathering (ESW) is a NET with as yet unknown potential to mitigate climate change. There are indications that ESW rates can be amplified by biotic activity, including that of earthworms. Earlier studies have suggested various pathways through which earthworms might enhance weathering rates, including the grinding of minerals in their gizzard, the stimulation of microbial communities in their gut, as well as the production of mucus rich in organic acids and digestive enzymes. Within this research, we aim to unravel the mechanisms through which earthworms increase mineral weathering rates, and ultimately to develop a bio-reactor in which these processes are optimized. As a first step, we carried out two experiments to determine the suitability of two earthworm species and to establish the optimal conditions for earthworms and mineral weathering in a small bio-reactor. The first study tested the potential of two endogeic earthworm species, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Aporrectodea caliginosa&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Allolobophora chlorotica&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, in a system with two types of rock flours (dunite and basalt) and three organic sources (hay, straw and co-digestate solid). The results showed that both earthworm species can thrive and remain active in the bio-reactor in the presence of basalt mixed with either co-digestate or straw. In the second study we tested the tolerance of the same two earthworm species to two temperatures exceeding earthworms ambient levels (20&amp;amp;#176;C and 25&amp;amp;#176;C) and two flow rates (50 ml/day and 80 ml/day) in a system with basalt and straw. The results showed that both earthworm species can survive and remain active at the highest temperature level and the highest flow rate.

This study was designed to assess CDR by dissolution of ultramafic sand (UMS) in artificial seawater (ASW). Fine grained UMS with an olivine content of ~75% was reacted in ASW for up to 134 days at 1 bar and 21.5‚Äì23.9¬∞C. A decline in total alkalinity (TA) was observed over the course of the experiments. This unexpected result indicates that TA removal via precipitation of cation-rich authigenic phases exceeded the production of TA induced by olivine dissolution. The TA decline was accompanied by a decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon and Ca concentrations presumably induced by CaCO 3 precipitation. Temporal changes in dissolved Si, Ca, Mg, and TA concentrations observed during the experiments were evaluated by a numerical model to identify secondary mineral phases and quantify rates of authigenic phase formation. The modeling indicates that CaCO 3 , FeOOH and a range of Mg-Si-phases were precipitated during the experiments. Chemical analysis of precipitates and reacted UMS surfaces confirmed that these authigenic phases accumulated in the batch reactors. Nickel released during olivine dissolution, a potential toxic element for certain organisms, was incorporated in the secondary phases and is thus not a suitable proxy for dissolution rates as proposed by earlier studies. The overall reaction stoichiometry derived from lab experiments was applied in a box model simulating atmospheric CO 2 uptake in a continental shelf setting induced by olivine addition. The model results indicate that CO 2 uptake is reduced by a factor of 5 due to secondary mineral formation and the buffering capacity of seawater. In comparable natural settings, olivine addition may thus be a less efficient CDR method than previously believed.",,tech|11,meth|01,cont|5,0.04,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.69,0.99,0.02,0.02,0.07,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.9,0.84,0.02,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2022.831587,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

This study aims to evaluate the potential of reusing Fe-rich mine waste for carbon sequestration by assessing the influence of pH condition, particle size fraction and reaction temperature on the carbonation reaction. A carbonation experiment was performed in a stainless steel reactor at ambient pressure and at a low temperature. The results indicated that the alkaline pH of waste samples was suitable for undergoing the carbonation process. Mineralogical analysis confirmed the presence of essential minerals for carbonation, i.e., magnetite, wollastonite, anorthite and diopside. The chemical composition exhibited the presence of iron and calcium oxides (39.58‚Äì62.95%) in wastes, indicating high possibilities for carbon sequestration. Analysis of the carbon uptake capacity revealed that at alkaline pH (8‚Äì12), 81.7‚Äì87.6 g CO2/kg of waste were sequestered. Furthermore, a particle size of &lt;38 ¬µm resulted in 83.8 g CO2/kg being sequestered from Fe-rich waste, suggesting that smaller particle sizes highly favor the carbonation process. Moreover, 56.1 g CO2/kg of uptake capacity was achieved under a low reaction temperature of 80 ¬∞C. These findings have demonstrated that Fe-rich mine waste has a high potential to be utilized as feedstock for mineral carbonation. Therefore, Fe-rich mine waste can be regarded as a valuable resource for carbon sinking while producing a value-added carbonate product.

A CO2 flux system directly measured CO2 removal rates and sensors tracked laboratory conditions and pore water saturation during a series of 2-week experiments.

Such carbon dioxide removal (CDR) systems, applied on a large scale, could help to meet internationally agreed targets for minimising climate change, but crucially we need to identify what materials could react fast enough to provide CDR at relevant climate change mitigation timescales. This study focuses on a range of silicate-dominated tailings, calculating their CDR potential from their chemical composition (specific capacity), estimated global production rates, and the speed of weathering under different reaction conditions. Tailings containing high abundances of olivine, serpentine and diopside show the highest CDR potential due to their favourable kinetics. We conclude that the most suitable tailings for CDR purposes are those associated with olivine dunites, diamond kimberlites, asbestos and talc serpentinites, Ni sulphides, and PGM layered mafic intrusions. We estimate the average annual global CDR potential of tailings weathered over the 70-year period 2030-2100 to be ~93 (unimproved conditions) to 465 (improved conditions) Mt/year. Results indicate that at least 30 countries possess tailings materials that, under improved conditions, may offer a route for CDR which is not currently utilised within the mining industry. By 2100, the total cumulative CDR could reach some 33 GtCO2, of which more than 60% is contributed by PGM tailings produced in Southern Africa, Russia, and North America. The global CDR potential could be increased by utilization of historic tailings and implementing measures to further enhance chemical reaction rates. If practical considerations can be addressed and enhanced weathering rates can be achieved, then CDR from suitable tailings could contribute significantly to national offset goals and global targets.

The ex situ enhanced weathering process chain consists of the acquisition of suitable natural or synthetic materials, grinding to a fine particle size, transportation, and application on suitable sites. Future enhanced weathering systems can be envisioned as supply chain-like networks which have to be optimized to deliver maximum CDR given physical constraints.

Enhanced weathering (EW) is a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategy aiming to increase drawdown of atmospheric CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; through accelerated carbonation weathering of crushed minerals with targeted carbonate sequestration in oceanic stores. To date, EW research has been focused on terrestrial application of crushed minerals, and the CDR capability of enhancing weathering via addition of crushed minerals to rivers from lime dosers is essentially unexplored. Lime dosers have been used for decades to directly deposit crushed carbonate rock to rivers as a function of river flow in Norway and Nova Scotia, Canada, yet their potential as a CDR tool has yet to be verified in the field. In this study, we adapt CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; flux sensors (eosFD) designed for soils to be deployed in rivers. We conducted field trials on the Killag River, Nova Scotia, upstream and downstream of a lime doser over a period of six weeks in the autumn of 2020.

Co-benefits related to soil health, resilience and crop yield make basalt excellently suited as a sustainably technology for GHG mitigation in agriculture. It has been shown that enhanced weathering is principally feasible on a global scale, but it remains unclear whether it can be implemented on a local level. With this in mind, we estimate the potential for CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; removal through a case study for Austria. Scenarios are estimated for three different particle size distributions (&amp;lt; 100 &amp;amp;#181;m, &amp;lt; 10 &amp;amp;#181;m and &amp;lt; 1 &amp;amp;#181;m). We find that transport related emissions may cancel out any drawdown if grain sizes (&amp;lt; 100 &amp;amp;#956;m) are used. However, under optimal transport conditions the large-scale application of particles with a diameter &amp;lt; 10 &amp;amp;#956;m may remove about 2% of Austria's annual Greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time supplying important plant nutrients. We discuss challenges towards this goal, including the enormous amounts of basalt needed and the energy requirement related to grinding, as well as uncertainties related to actual field weathering rates. Those uncertainties hinder the precise quantification of CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; drawdown as of now.

Enhanced weathering&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;is a NCS that aims to increase the weathering reaction rates of silicate minerals, by amending soils with crushed reactive minerals. Various studies have shown that this technique is favored by hot and humid climates (i.e., tropical ecosystems), since weathering reactions are mostly effective under high temperature and soil moisture. Despite olivine dissolution dynamics in laboratory conditions are quite well known, understanding and modeling them in field is still a challenge. Indeed, apart from some pot experiments involving soils of agricultural fields, only few weathering models are available. Given the urgency of the problem, models play a very important role for extrapolating results of laboratory and field experiments in both time and space, as well as for quantifying the impact of hydroclimatic fluctuations on the involved biogeochemical processes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The present study explores the role of hydrological processes on long-term Forsterite dissolution, a highly reactive silicate mineral also known as Mg-olivine or simply olivine. Toward this goal, we present a novel dynamic mass balance model coupling ecohydrological and biogeochemical dynamics, including mineral dissolution. Results under different climate scenarios highlight that hydrological fluctuations lead to hysteretic patterns of weathering rate with soil moisture, meaning that the process maintains a memory of past events (i.e., dry or wet periods). The model allows to explore the twofold role of organic matter on enhanced weathering; indeed, while its decomposition is a source of CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, organic matter also increases the soil CEC, thus buffering changes in soil pH. Carbon sequestration and nutrients availability due to enhanced weathering are quantified, in this study, as a function of MAP (Mean Annual Precipitation). Average CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2 &amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;that reacts with olivine can exceed 40 t ha&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1 &amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;y&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; for MAP higher than 2000 mm, condition that is always reached in the tropics.

The main challenge is doing it economically and energy-efficiently. Recently, many studies have focused on the aqueous reaction of carbon dioxide with the alkaline earth minerals such as serpentine, Mg-rich olivine and wollastonite. Nevertheless, Fe-rich olivines have been poorly studied because of their high energy demand, which make them unfeasible for industrial implementation. This article describes the feasibility of an indirect mineral carbonation process using silicic, Fe-rich mining waste with direct flue gas CO2 via iron complexation using 2,2‚Ä≤-bipyridine. The overall process was performed in three main steps: leaching, iron complexation, and aqueous mineral carbonation reactions. The preferential parameters resulted in a recirculation scenario, where 38% of Fe cations were leached, complexed, and reacted under mild conditions. CO2 uptake of 57.3% was achieved, obtaining a Fe-rich carbonate. These results are promising for the application of mineral carbonation to reduce CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the greenhouse gas balance had a global vision of the overall reaction‚Äôs feasibility. The results showed a positive balance in CO2 removal, with an estimated 130 kg CO2/ton of residue.

It has been shown that enhanced weathering is principally feasible on a global scale, but it remains unclear whether it can be implemented on a local level. This information is however vital, to evaluate, if enhanced weathering should be further considered as a factor to alleviate the impact of the climate crisis. With this in mind, this article reviews of the current state of research and estimates the potential for CO2 removal on regional scale through a case study for Austria. Scenarios are estimated for three different particle size distributions (< 100 ¬µm, < 10 ¬µm and < 1 ¬µm). Transport related emissions may cancel out any drawdown if grain sizes (< 100 Œºm) are used. However, under optimal transport conditions the large-scale application of particles with a diameter < 10 Œºm may remove about 2% of Austria's annual Greenhouse gas emissions. We discuss challenges towards this goal, including the enormous amounts of basalt needed and the energy requirement related to grinding, as well as uncertainties related to actual field weathering rates. Those uncertainties hinder the precise quantification of CO2 drawdown as of now.

Rohling,Mother Nature To The Rescue?,,"Now we come to the key issue. Many discussions about climate change turn to the well- known fact that (very) large CO2 fluctuations have happened in the geological past. This is then taken to imply that ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt worry: nature has seen this all before, and will somehow clean up our external carbon emissions.‚Äù The veracity of this sentiment can be tested by considering the main mechanisms available in nature for extracting carbon from the atmosphere-ocean system. These are weathering, reforestation, and carbon burial in soils and sediments. In the next section, we look at the potential of these processes. Thereafter, we consider the case for human intervention, and potential ways forward. A first mechanism by which nature has dealt with past high- CO2 episodes is chemical weathering of rocks. In warmer and more humid climates, chemical weathering rates are increased, and this extracts CO2 from the atmosphere. However, CO2 removal through weathering at natural rates is an extremely slow process, which operates over hundreds of thousands to millions of years. Given time, there is no doubt that natural weathering will be capable of eventually removing the excess CO2, but this process is so slow that it offers no solace for the future, unless we are prepared to wait many hundreds of thousands of years. There may be some future in artificially increasing the weathering processes to remove anthropogenic carbon, but this is in its infancy‚Äîwe will revisit this in sections 6.2 and 6.3. A second mechanism for carbon extraction from the atmosphere-ocean system concerns expansion of the biosphere, most notably through reforestation. We have discussed this before in terms of expansion and contraction of the biosphere during ice- age cycles. In today‚Äôs case, carbon extraction through biosphere expansion requires first that the industrial age‚Äôs trend of net deforestation is reversed. Interestingly, this actually may have happened at around 2003. Between 2003 and 2014, net global vegeta¬¨tion increased by about 4 GtC (i.e., at an average rate of about 0.4 GtC per year), due to a lucky combination of increased rainfall on the savannahs of Australia, Africa, and South America, regrowth of forests on abandoned farmland in Russia and former Soviet republics, and massive tree- planting projects in China.",,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.03,0.05,0.1,0.02,0.02,0.06,0.01,0.76,0.16,0.04,0.02,0.21,0.19,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.88,0.01,0.01,0.08,0.04,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.04,0.96,,https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190910877.003.0009,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Enhanced weathering (EW) is a NET with considerable carbon sequestration potential. It is based on accelerated chemical reactions between alkaline minerals and water and carbon dioxide to generate bicarbonates in runoff that flows into the ocean to achieve long-term carbon sequestration. EW also presents a potential valorisation pathway for the use of industrial residues. Therefore, we selected non-hazardous industrial wastes (NHIWs) as the alkaline mineral of EW. The processes for implementing EW (crushing, transporting, and spreading NHIWs) will produce additional CO2 emissions and require energy input, and these values may vary in the life cycle of the specific facilities. To address this gap, we developed a multi-period mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to optimize NHIWs flows between sources and sinks over the planning horizon, while considering the annual CO2 sequestration target for achieving regional carbon drawdown. Our results show that the unit net CO2 sequestration cost for removing 1% and 1.5% annual carbon emissions of Shandong province is $273 and $378 /t CO2, respectively. It is estimated that from 2020 to 2030, the maximum CO2 sequestration of NHIWs produced by Shandong province will be 305.78 Mt CO2.

The coming decades will witness the challenges associated with the food security, land availability, clean water availability, and energy security. These issues directly or indirectly affect the various components of the Earth‚Äôs Critical Zone (ECZ). Our natural resources are finite and hence a policy framework is urgently required to deal with the growing demand in food, clean energy, and water in sustainable ways. This work characterises some key components of the ECZ such as wetlands, through modelling and computational simulation approaches. A data-driven methodology known as the system identification is used to devise a nonlinear dynamic model of the tropical wetlands. The dataset used in the study corresponds to a Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites. The model gives some useful insights about the dynamics of tropical wetlands and the possible effects of climate change on wetlands. The prediction power of this model is shown to be superior than the competing analytical models representing the inundation dynamics. This work also contributes towards the theoretical advancements in the nonlinear system identification method by proposing a new algorithm capable of performing the model structure selection in the NARMAX model class under the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework. In addition to the data-driven approach, this thesis also switches to analytical modelling framework for investigating the sustainable ways of food production and climate change mitigation through a Negative Emission Technology (NET) known as enhanced weathering. The recent reports of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have highlighted the need of an NET to meet the ambitious targets of lowering the global temperature. A process-based model representing the enhanced weathering of a mineral is developed and integrated with standard soil, vegetation process models. The integrated model is termed as the Integrated Enhanced Weathering Critical Zone Model, which is used to analyse the potentials of enhanced weathering in the UK conditions. The simulation results indicate that with the implementation of enhanced weathering in the UK farmlands, we can reduce the atmospheric carbon through sequestration as well as increase the crop yield substantially. In another words, food security and climate change mitigation can be addressed simultaneously. In a nutshell, the simulation results and analyses of this thesis can be used to design further experiments for investigating the ECZ processes like inundation dynamics and enhanced weathering.

If a 2¬∞C warming by 2100 is to be prevented, it will become important to adopt strategies that not only avoid CO 2 emissions but also allow for the direct removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere, enabling the intervention of climate change. The primary direct removal methods discussed in this review include land management and mineral carbonation in addition to bioenergy and direct air capture with carbon capture and reliable storage. These methods are discussed in detail, and their potential for CO 2 removal is assessed. The global upper bound for annual CO 2 removal was estimated to be 12, 10, 6, and 5 GtCO 2 /year for bioenergy with carbon capture and reliable storage (BECCS) , direct air capture with reliable storage (DACS) , land management, and mineral carbonation, respectively‚Äîgiving a cumulative value of ~35 GtCO 2 /year. However, in the case of DACS , global data on the overlap of low‚Äêemission energy sources and reliable CO 2 storage opportunities‚Äîset as a qualification for DAC viability‚Äîwere unavailable, and the potential upper bound estimate is thus considered conservative. The upper bounds on the costs associated with the direct CO 2 removal methods varied from approximately $100/ tCO 2 (land management, BECCS , and mineral carbonation) to $1000/ tCO 2 for DACS (again, these are the upper bounds for costs). In this review, these direct CO 2 removal technologies are found to be technically viable and are potentially important options in preventing 2¬∞C warming by 2100.

Box 80015, 3508 TA Utrecht, The Netherlands","Enhanced weathering of olivine has been suggested as a measure to lower the atmospheric CO2 level and it might also mitigate ocean acidification. This study aimed to characterise how olivine can weather in seawater, to elucidate the role of secondary precipitation and to ascertain the efficiency in terms of molar CO2 removal per mole of olivine dissolution. Geochemical thermodynamic equilibrium modelling was used, which considered both the variable mineralogical composition of olivine and the kinds of secondary precipitates that may be formed. The advantage is that such an approach is independent from local or regional factors as temperature, related kinetics, mineralogy, etc. The results show that the efficiency falls when secondary precipitates are formed. When Fe-bearing olivine undergoes weathering in an oxic environment, Fe(III) hydroxides will inevitably be formed, and as a result of this acidifying process, CO2 could be released to the atmosphere. This might also enhance ocean acidification when Fe-rich olivine becomes used. Ocean alkalinisation only happens when more than 1mol/kgH2O Mg-rich olivine weathers. Maintenance of supersaturation for calcite or aragonite as holds in seawater reduces the efficiency by about a factor of two compared to the efficiency without secondary precipitation. Precipitation of sepiolite as Mg silicate reduces the efficiency even more. Magnesite precipitation has a similar effect to Ca carbonate precipitation, but according to the literature magnesite precipitation is improbable at ambient conditions and relatively low supersaturation. When less than 0.05mmololivine/kg(seawater) weathers the efficiency is slightly different than at higher intensities, due to strong buffering by seawater alkalinity.",,tech|11,meth|02,cont|5,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.6,1.0,0.02,0.02,0.11,0.02,0.01,0.03,0.05,0.97,0.03,0.01,0.05,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Alternatively, the addition of lime (produced from calcining carbonate minerals) to the surface ocean (‚Äúocean liming‚Äù), which results in an increase in ocean pH and a draw-down of atmospheric CO2 has been proposed as a ‚Äúgeoengineering‚Äù technology, which stores carbon as dissolved alkalinity in the surface ocean. Combining these approaches, in which the magnesium carbonate minerals produced from mineral carbonation are used as a feedstock for ocean liming (mineral carbonation-ocean liming; MC‚ÄìOL), may reduce the limitations of individual technologies while maximizing the benefits. Approximately 1.9 metric tons of magnesium silicate (producing 0.7 ton of magnesium oxide) are required for every net ton of CO2 sequestered. A total of 0.7 ton of CO2 is produced from this activity, 70% of which is high-purity (>98%) from calcining and potentially amenable for geological storage. The technology can be conceptually viewed as an alternative to direct air capture and swaps ambient CO2 for high-purity point source CO2. MC‚ÄìOL requires approximately 4.9 and 2.2 GJ of thermal and electrical energy ton‚Äì1 of CO2 sequestered. MC‚ÄìOL has less demand for geological storage; only 0.5 ton of CO2 needs to be injected for every ton of CO2 removed from the atmosphere.

If undertaken on a large scale, enormous amounts of carbon dioxide will have to be taken care of. This paper investigates how mechanical activation of olivine and other Ca or Mg containing silicates can increase the mineral‚Äôs reactivity. Tests by grinding in a planetary mill have been done to investigate the effects of mechanical activation and other surface changes. The reactivity towards HCl and CO2 has been determined as a function of grinding variables. Prolonged dry milling of olivine resulted in highly aggregated products, which were more reactive with respect to dissolution in acid than their respective BET surface areas would suggest. The initial breaking of bonds appears to give more reactivity on an energy usage basis than longer time activation. Most mechanical activation testwork so far has been carried out in batch mode. The result is diminishing effect of activation with increased grinding time.

The engineered weathering of silicate minerals as a means of permanent carbon storage has unique advantages such as the abundance of naturally occurring calcium and magnesium-bearing minerals and the formation of environmentally-benign and geologically stable solids via a thermodynamically favored carbonation reaction. However, several challenges need to be overcome to successfully deploy carbon mineralization on a large scale. In particular, the acceleration of the rate-limiting mineral dissolution step along with process optimization is essential to ensure the economic feasibility of the proposed carbon storage technology. In this study, the effect of various types of chelating agents on the dissolution rate of calcium-bearing silicate mineral, wollastonite, was explored to accelerate its weathering rate. It was found that chelating agents such as acetic acid and gluconic acid significantly improved the dissolution kinetics of wollastonite even at a much diluted concentration of 0.006 M by complexing with calcium in the mineral matrix.

The evolution of the precipitated crystalline phases was monitored by X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetry, along with structural characterization by nitrogen physisorption, electron microscopy and small-angle scattering. Complete hydration of the samples was always found prior to the onset of carbon sequestration, which depended on the nanostructure of the samples. Hence, carbonation started after 300 h of weathering for samples with a specific surface area of 40 m2/g, whereas carbonation of the samples with 20 m2/g occurred after 550 h. Full carbonation from atmospheric CO2 (100% efficiency) was obtained in all cases.

Restoration approaches using different vegetations and reclamation methods have been implemented to address this issue. In this review, paper, different studies focusing on the effect of the restoration of mining sites on the accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) were analyzed. SOC in reclaimed mining soil (RMS) increased considerably after various restoration efforts were implemented. The amount of SOC accumulated in RMS was mostly influenced by the restoration age, vegetation type, and substrate or type of reclamation used. From the scientific papers analyzed, we found that SOC accumulation increases with restoration age; however, vegetation type and reclamation have varied effects. According to the review, the restoration of mine sites with vegetation resulted in a rate of SOC accumulation ranging from 0.37 to 5.68 Mg SOC ha‚àí1 year‚àí1. Climate conditions influenced the type of vegetation used for restoration. Regrading, liming, NPK fertilization, and seeding a mix of legumes and grasses were the most efficient reclamation techniques.

This was done with a view to extending knowledge on the nature of soil properties under long-term land-use practices. The study investigated six types of land-use: paddock, continuously cropped, secondary forest, teak, oil palm, and cacao plantations. Soil strength and saturated hydraulic conductivity were determined in-situ at two soil depths (0‚Äì15 and 15‚Äì30 cm) across the land-use types. Soil samples were collected to determine particle size distribution, bulk density, aggregate stability, pH, organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus. The data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance and Duncan's multiple range test was used to separate significant means at p ‚â§ 0.05. The results showed that land-use types such as forest, cacao and continuously cropped had higher saturated hydraulic conductivity, while soil bulk density was highest under continuously cropped land-use type (1.55 g cm‚àí3). The soil aggregates of forest, teak, and oil palm land-use types were more stable, but soil under oil palm land-use had the highest soil strength (5.65 kg m‚àí2). Soil pH across the land-use types was slightly acidic to strongly acidic, while soil organic carbon was least in continuously cropped land (3.87 g kg‚àí1). The total nitrogen content of soil across the land-use types was high, but the available phosphorus was low. Paddock, cacao, and continuously cropped land-use types had higher cation exchange capacity. The results implied that continuous cultivation led to depletion in soil physical and chemical properties, whereas, afforestation and cultivation of tree crops conserved soil properties better. Therefore, the establishment of tree crop plantations and conservative soil management practices such as manuring, mulching, liming, and conservation tillage were suggested to prevent agricultural lands from degradation in areas with soils under similar conditions.",,tech|04,meth|00,cont|5,0.02,0.03,0.02,0.03,0.9,0.38,0.1,0.06,0.14,0.03,0.77,0.03,0.02,0.01,0.04,0.06,0.02,0.97,0.04,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05090,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Soils that have low cation exchange capacity, high aluminium content, and low basic cation status are especially prone to rapid acidification under intensive cultivation. Yield response to lime and gypsum applications is high on these soils, but the prohibitive costs of liming, coupled with the slow movement of lime and gypsum under no-till, are major problems encountered by farmers. This chapter proffers options for integrated acidity management under smallholder systems, towards reducing the reliance upon lime for sustainable crop production. Soil management practices that improve the soil organic matter content bring about opportunities to better manage acidity through increases in the buffering capacity of the soil against pH change. Within the context of conservation agriculture, farmers need recommendations for no-tillage techniques to improve liming efficiency. These recommendations include a ‚Äòonce-off tillage‚Äô for lime incorporation, split lime applications, mulching for improving infiltration, and timely application of the lime, among others. The impact of soil acidity in crop production systems could also be reduced by adoption of acid-tolerant cultivars.

For this purpose, biochar has been found to be more effective than other organic soil amendments due to biochar's stability in soil, and thus can extend the benefits over long duration. This review synthesizes information concerning the present status of biochar application in highly weathered tropical soils highlighting promising application strategies for improving resource use efficiency in terms of economic feasibility. In this respect, biochar has been found to improve crop productivity and soil quality consistently through liming and fertilization effects in low pH and infertile soils under low-input conditions typical of weathered tropical soils.

However, strategies for the reduction of costs of biochar production and application to increase the material's use efficiency need future development.

However, quantitative data are needed to better understand the productivity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural fields amended with biochar. To assess the impacts of the four biochars on soil properties, forage productivity, and GHG emissions, a 1-year field experiment was conducted in a Humic Haploxerands (Andisol). Three manure-derived biochars and one wood residue biochar (all pyrolyzed at 550 ¬∞C) were applied at rates of 1% (equivalent to 11 t ha-1) in two parallel and independent experiments. The changes in (i) soil chemical properties and yield of Sorghum sudangrass (S. bicolor√óS. bicolor var. Sudanese) and (ii) soil CO2 and N2O emissions were monitored. Two controls, with and without NPK, were included. The added amendments produced from residues of poultry and pig systems increased soil pH by 0.73 and 0.19 units, respectively. Increased sorghum yield were associated with fertilizer and the liming potential of the added biochar. Soil total carbon (TC) increased with the addition of different biochars, especially during the wood biochar treatment. Biochar application, regardless of the feedstock, had no significant impact on the cumulative soil CO2 emitted after a year. Soil N2O fluxes decreased (23%-50%) in treatments containing biochars with low mineral N contents and high C stability (i.e., low H:OC and Cox:TC ratios). NPK treatment resulted in the highest N2O emissions. Wood residue-derived biochar has a great potential in mitigating climate change, reducing soil N2O emissions, and promoting soil C storage. Manure-derived biochars could be instrumental in circular economy livestock systems, where pyrolyzed animal manure can satisfy the demand for nutrients and/or liming of Andisols under sustainable forage models.",,tech|04,meth|00,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150465,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Different soil amendments have been proposed to decrease Cd accumulation in rice grain by either decreasing soil Cd availability, introducing competitive ions on Cd uptake, or down-regulating the expression of transporters for Cd uptake. However, the effectiveness of soil amendments applied alone or in combinations needs to be tested under field conditions. Here, we present results of field trials with two rice cultivars differing in Cd accumulation grown at three field sites in southern China in two years, to investigate the effects of two Mn-containing soil amendments (MnO2, Mn-loaded biochar (MB)), Si fertilizer (Si), limestone, and K2SO4, as well as interactions among MnO2, Si, and limestone on decreasing Cd accumulation in rice grain. We found that single applications of MnO2 or MB to acidic soils low in Mn decreased grain Cd concentrations by 44‚Äì53 % or 78‚Äì82 %, respectively, over two years without decrease in performance. These effects were comparable to or greater than those induced by limestone liming alone (45‚Äì62 %). Strong interactions between MnO2 and limestone resulting from their influence on soil extractable Cd and Mn led to non-additive effects on lowering grain Cd. MB addition minimized grain Cd concentrations, primarily by increasing extractable and dissolved Mn concentrations, but also by decreasing Cd extractability in soil. In comparison, Si and K2SO4 amendments affected grain Cd levels only weakly. We conclude that the amendments that decrease labile Cd and increase labile Mn in soils are most effective at reducing Cd accumulation in rice grain, thus contributing to food safety.",,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.47,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.67,0.69,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.98,0.02,0.02,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117918,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Here, we present data of a pot experiment consisting of eleven treatments to evaluate RHB, lime, and phosphorus effect on soil phosphorus availability, CO2 emission, nutrient uptake, and yield performance of maize. Co-application of RHB (10 and 15 t ha‚àí1) and lime (100% and 75%) was made with different rates of P (100%, 75%, and 50%).

The maximum soil pH increased by 36.75%, the highest available P increased by 158.75%, whilst, the exchangeable Al content reduced by 96.84% compared to the control treatment.

Here, we examined the effects of two different biochars, i.e., rice husk biochar (RHB) and oil palm empty fruit bunches biochar (EFBB), and lime on nutrient availability, the yield of maize, and soil CO2 emission of acid soil.

These changes in soil properties significantly increased maize yield (by 77.59%) and nutrient uptake compared to the control. Between the two biochars, RHB was relatively more effective in making these changes than EFBB.

As large acreages of arable land are limed annually, exploring soil management practices that reduce aglime-induced CO2 emissions from acid soils while maintaining or improving the soil quality is paramount to mitigating the effects of global climate change. This study, therefore, assessed the effects of organic residues and ammonium on CO2 emissions and soil quality indicators in two limed soils. Two contrasting acid soils (Nariva series, Mollic Fluvaquents and Piarco series, Typic Kanhaplaquults) were amended with varying combinations of aglime (0% and 0.2% w/w CaCO3), organic residue (0% and 5% w/w biochar or poultry litter), and NH4-N (0% and 0.02% w/w) and were incubated in 300 mL glass jars for 31 days. The sampling for CO2 was performed on 11 occasions over the course of the incubation, while soil sampling was conducted at the end. The results indicate that aglime application significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the cumulative CO2 emissions in all cases except with the addition of poultry litter. Alternatively, ammonium did not regulate the effect of aglime on CO2 emissions, which was l because of the low rate at which it was applied in comparison to aglime. The results also showed that poultry litter significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the soil electrical conductivity (EC), available nitrogen (N), and pH, especially in the Piarco soil, while the hardwood biochar had little to no effect on the soil properties. Our findings indicate the potential for utilizing poultry litter to reduce the impact of aglime on CO2 emissions while improving the soil quality.

The reduction reached 71%, 87% and 92% for Cd, Zn and Pb respectively in the presence of 10% biochar. Twelve weeks after sowing, all plants cultivated on the untreated soil and on the soil amended by biochar at 1% had died, while the plants grew normally on the soil that had the other treatments. Compared to liming, treatment with 10% biochar proved equally efficient in reducing metal concentrations in shoots but the biomass production tripled as a result of the soil fertility improvement. Thus, in addition to C sequestration, the incorporation of biochar into metal-contaminated soils could make it possible to cultivate bioenergy crops without encroaching on agricultural lands. Although additional investigations are needed, we suggest that the harvested biomass might in turn be used as feedstock for pyrolysis to produce both bioenergy and new biochar, which could contribute further to the reduction of CO2 emission.",,tech|09,meth|00,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2013.07.019,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I performed two experiments testing the effects of AM fungi on survival, growth, and nutrition of NWC seedlings; and one molecular study to determine the habitat effects on community composition of NWC root-associated fungi. First, a greenhouse AM inoculation experiment was conducted in factorial combination with fertilization and liming to examine conditional effectiveness of AM fungal inoculation. Second, a field experiment in a poor fen was conducted to determine effectiveness of AM fungal inoculation, AM plant proximity, and environmental factors on survival, growth, and nutrition of NWC seedlings. Third, an observational study employed Illumina sequencing to determine habitat effects on diversity and composition of NWC root-associated fungal communities in mine tailings, peatlands, and uplands. AM inoculation of NWC had different outcomes in the greenhouse and field experiments. In the greenhouse AM fungi significantly increased all plant growth and many nutrient metrics, whereas in the field there were no significant inoculum effects. This might be due to the differences in several experimental conditions. Seedlings in the greenhouse grew under high environmental control, higher pH, using commercial inoculum, and with no competition. In contrast, the field experiment was conducted without environmental controls, with native inoculum under more acidic and competitive conditions. However, in addition to pH and light effects, we observed positive AM plant proximity effects on growth and nutrition, perhaps indicating a mycorrhizal role in NWC seedling success in poor fens. In the fungal community analysis, unidentified Glomeraceae were the dominant AM fungi across all habitats. Total fungal and AM fungal community richness was higher in bog and upland than in stamp sands. Fungal community composition within Glomeromycota and all fungal taxa were both significantly different between the mine tailing and the other two habitats.

However, there is a discrepancy in our understanding of weathering and dissolution in these wastes, with dissolution and reaction rates in field studies exceeding those predicted by experiments under far-from-equilibrium conditions. To reconcile these differences, a series of flow-through dissolution experiments at 25 ¬∞C and 1atm were performed to investigate the short-term dissolution kinetics of ultramafic tailings and minerals. Results show that mineral and tailings samples have two stages of dissolution: a fast, transient (or labile) stage, and a slow, stoichiometric stage. Fast releasing labile cations (i.e. labile Mg2+) are sourced from trace minerals with a high reaction rate (e.g. brucite) and from non-stoichiometric surface reaction processes of major minerals (e.g. serpentine). These cations are missing from most geochemical models for mineral weathering. The implication of these results is that the initial transient dissolution of minerals, which is typically ignored during geochemical investigations into bulk dissolution rates, is the missing ingredient for understanding dissolution of mine tailings. Labile cations released during the initial transient dissolution process have value for rapid and low-cost carbon capture and storage techniques as they represent reactivity, capacity, and the best opportunities to deploy low-cost carbon sequestration techniques using mine tailings and other industrial wastes. The presence of labile cations and changing reaction rates over time may also suggest that short-term reactivity examined during field tests may overestimate long-term carbon capture potential of some sites.",,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.21,0.01,0.02,0.07,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.83,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.14,0.87,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105285,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

At Montecastelli (Tuscany, Italy), on-going spontaneous mineral CO2 sequestration is enhanced by brucite-rich serpentinized dunites. The dunites are embedded in brucite-free serpentinized harzburgites that belong to the ophiolitic Ligurian Units (Northern Apennine thrust-fold belt). Two main serpentinization events produced two distinct mineral assemblages in the reactive dunite bodies. The first assemblage consists of low-T pseudomorphic, mesh-textured serpentine, Fe-rich brucite (up to 20 mol.% Fe(OH)2) and minor magnetite. This was overprinted by a non-pseudomorphic, relatively high-T assemblage consisting of serpentine, Fe-poor brucite (ca. 4 mol% Fe(OH)2) and abundant magnetite. The harzburgite host rock developed a brucite-free paragenesis made of serpentine and magnetite. Present-day interaction of serpentinized dunites with slightly acidic and oxidizing meteoric water, enhances brucite dissolution and leads to precipitation of both Mg-Fe layered double hydroxides (coalingite-pyroaurite, LDHs) and hydrous Mg carbonates (hydromagnesite and nesquehonite). In contrast, the brucite-free serpentinized harzburgites are not affected by the carbonation process. In the serpentinized dunites, different carbonate minerals form depending on brucite composition (Fe-rich vs Fe-poor). Reactions in serpentinized dunites containing Fe-rich brucite produce a carbonate assemblage dominated by LDHs and minor amount of hydromagnesite. Serpentinites with a Fe-poor brucite assemblage contain large amounts of hydromagnesite and minor LDHs. Efficiency of CO2 mineral sequestration is different in the two cases owing to the distinct carbon content of LDHs (ca. 1.5 wt.%) and hydromagnesite (ca. 10 wt.%).

The scientific community is experimenting with various emission reduction and carbon capture and storage strategies. Mineral sequestration of carbon with alkaline industrial residues is one such emerging emission reduction technology which is being researched for its ability to be integrated into industrial plants, where both carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ)and alkaline solid residues are generated on site. This concept can be applied to the coal-fired power generation industry, which produces enormous quantities of coal fly ash as a solid by-product along with massive emissions of gaseous CO‚ÇÇ with the flue gas stream. Therefore, the mineral trapping of CO‚ÇÇ with coal fly ash can help to sustain coal-based power generation, while bringing added advantages to fly ash disposal due to the favourable chemical changes which occur in fly ash during the above carbonation process. However, mineral carbonation to date remains an immature technology due to its main drawbacks related to kinetics and extensive research is necessary to find acceleration to accelerate mineral sequestration. The main aim of the present thesis is to investigate the effect of operational parameters on the accelerated carbonation of coal combustion fly ash and to study the effect of carbonation on the final disposal of fly ash, especially in relation to agricultural soil amendment.
The research work is based on experimental studies conducted in the laboratory and in a greenhouse facility. The accelerated carbonation tests for fly ash were conducted in a newly-developed reactor facility in  the Deep Earth Energy Research Laboratory in the Civil Engineering Department at the Clayton campus of Monash University. The main component of this facility is a continuously stirred cylindrical tank equipped with adjustable temperature and pressure mechanisms and monitoring and data acquisition systems. The fly ash materials were collected from the collection ponds of three major power plants located in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, Australia. The carbonation reactions were designed to test the effect of reaction temperature (in the range of 20 ‚Å∞C to 80 ‚Å∞C), initial CO‚ÇÇ pressure inside the reactor (in the range of 1MPa to 10 MPa), water-to-solid ratio or solid dosage (in the range of 0.1 to 1) and the super-critical phase of CO‚ÇÇ. In addition, the effect of fly ash particle size was tested with five different particle size categories varying",,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.13,0.01,0.01,0.09,0.32,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.04,0.53,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.98,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.07,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/Study_of_the_accelerated_carbonation_of_coal_fly_ash_for_carbon_dioxide_sequestration_and_soil_amendment/4679341/1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Here we provide a micro- and nanostructural characterization of the olivine/water interface during the carbonation of forsteritic olivine at 150 ¬∞C and pCO‚ÇÇ = 100 bar. When the reaction starts under oxic conditions, the observed temporal sequence of interfacial layers consists of: a hematite/SiO2(am) assemblage, Fe-rich phyllosilicates with mixed Fe valence and a non-passivating Fe-free amorphous SiO2 layer, which allows the formation of ferroan magnesite. In contrast, starting at micro-oxic conditions, carbonation rates are much faster, with no real evidence of interfacial layers. Separate deposits of goethite/lepidocrocite in the early stages of the reaction and then formation of magnetite are observed at these conditions, while precipitation of siderite/magnesite proceeds unhindered. The evolution of the redox conditions during the reaction progress controls the sequence of the observed reaction products and the passivating properties of Fe-Si-rich interfacial layers. These findings have important implications for modeling the carbonation of ultramafic rocks under different oxygen fugacity conditions as well as for understanding the technological implications of adding accessory gases to CO2 in carbon capture and storage mineralization processes involving ultrabasic rocks.",,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.34,0.01,0.01,0.04,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.59,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.01,0.99,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2015-5340,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

We characterized the culturable fungal isolates at three sampling sites representative of different degrees of mineral weathering by isolating the genomic subunits and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA genes using PCR and sequencing of cloned fragments. We chose the specific strain primarily identified as Talaromyces sp. for the further experiments with lizardite because of this strain's remarkable tolerance to high [Mg2+] (1 mol¬∑L‚àí1) and [Ni2+] (10 mM¬∑L‚àí1) levels in the screening test and its ubiquity in the most severely weathered samples. Results of dissolution experiments revealed that both magnesium-release rate and efficiency were significantly increased (e.g., by a factor of up to 15) in the presence of fungal cells than those in the abiotic controls. The enhanced dissolution of lizardite was mainly attributed to the fungal production of organic acids including oxalic acid, gluconic acid, formic acid, and fumaric acid added to the solution. The proton-promoted dissolution, however, was indicated not to be the only mechanism for fungus-lizardite interactions as much lesser Mg (in wt.%) was recovered in the abiotic system where the solution pH was constantly adjusted to match that of the fungal system. We also explored the dependence of fungal dissolution (of lizardite) on temperature and mineral particle sizes. In particular, we found that up to ‚àº 50 wt.% of Mg was released from mineral particles of ‚àº 50 Œºm within 30 days at 38¬∞C, ‚àº 26% and 8% higher than that at 18¬∞C and 28¬∞C, respectively. At the same temperature of 28¬∞C, the Mg-release efficiency increased from 12.2 wt% for particles of ‚àº 270 Œºm to 38.4 wt% for those of ‚àº100 Œºm although no apparent difference was recognized when the particle size decreased below 100 Œºm. The nonlinear correlation of dissolution rates with particle surface areas suggested that the dissolution process was controlled by mineral surface-structural modification along with Mg release and by fungal cells‚Äô interaction with these surface structures. An amorphous layer of Mg-depleted silica was detected at the reacted mineral surface by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Formation of glushinskite (MgC2O4¬∑2H2O) was also observed when oxalate was accumulated to certain concentrations in the solution. Overall, this study showed that the isolated Talaromyces sp. was a promising bioagent to improve the efficacy of cation release from serpentine minerals for the purpose of carbon sequestration and resource recovery.",,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2013.835888,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

These processes may be influenced by land use and cover change, and abandonment especially in the upper soil organic layer. Seven environments from cultivation to late abandonment, with the same soil type classified as Lithic Xerorthent, were tested to ascertain the respiration capacity according to the current use and cover, and to establish the ability to preserve and eventually increase the organic matter pools after abandonment. Given the importance of carbon dioxide measurements at soil surface, a comparison between the classic soda lime method (SL) and a rapid method based on infrared sensor analyzer (IR) was performed from autumn 2008 to autumn 2009 in the field. The field measurements of CO 2  proved significant correlations between the values from the two techniques under the same natural conditions and along the period of observation. However, the values of CO 2  measured by the soda lime method were always higher than those obtained by the infrared analyzer. This pattern was attributed to the difference in time of measurement, larger in the former method, and type of measurement technique. Despite that the trend of measured CO 2  values was rather similar along the year. On average, the highest values of CO 2  emission in the field were recorded in the warmest periods of the year and with soil surface moisture not lower than 3% independently on the method used. High soil surface temperature with soil moisture below 3% decreased drastically the CO 2  production from the dry soil. The cultivated environments and soil under forests have resulted higher CO 2  producers than abandoned soils depending on the age of abandonment, climatic conditions, and within abandonment perturbations. Those abandoned soils preserved by perturbations like wildfire showed a higher potential for accumulating organic carbon, as indicated by the lowest emission of CO 2  with respect to SOC content, during the period of observation. Results demonstrated the reliability of the methods used to evaluate the soil carbon dioxide production capacity and allowed to classify through environments with increasing potential for carbon sequestration.

However, no assessment has been made covering the entire United States detailing their geographical distribution and extent, or evaluating their potential for use in mineral carbonation. Researchers at Columbia University and the U.S. Geological Survey have developed a digital geologic database of ultramafic rocks in the continental United States. Data were compiled from varied-scale geologic maps of magnesium-silicate ultramafic rocks. These rock types are potentially suitable as source material for mineral carbon-dioxide sequestration. The focus of the national-scale map is entirely on suitable ultramafic rock types, which typically consist primarily of olivine and serpentine minerals.

This process can be induced artificially at high pressures and temperatures and therefore has potential to be adapted as a carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. Large-scale surface and subsurface carbonate deposits of probable Quaternary age are associated with major faulting across the Oman-UAE ophiolite. Here, fractured rock forms a natural fluid pathway and increases the surface area available for carbonation. Modern springs along these faults typically discharge hyperalkaline (pH ‚àº11), Ca(OH)2-rich waters that precipitate carbonates on reaction with atmospheric CO2. Carbonates formed by absorption of atmospheric CO2 into Ca(OH)2 waters tend to display low Œ¥13C (<<‚àí20% PDB) as result of kinetic fractionation. However, ancient travertines show a large range in Œ¥13C of ‚àí10.5 to ‚àí21.8% PDB, produced by the mixing of the low Œ¥13C end member with other carbon sources such as limestones or organic-derived soil bicarbonate. Strontium isotope ratios of samples indicate fluids that formed calcite and magnesite veins may have interacted with limestones around and beneath the ophiolite. These are a carbon source which can easily be reworked and incorporated into carbonate deposits elsewhere. Carbonate deposits may not be created solely from atmospheric CO2, but instead represent a mixture of carbon sources. Failure to account for multiple carbon sources or recycled carbon may result in poor estimates of the rates and volumes of carbon that natural systems sequester.

A frequently discussed option is carbon capture and storage (CCS), where CO2 emissions from point sources are captured and stored in geologic structures. However, concerns about risks of leakages of CO2 from geological storage have been raised. These risks could be avoided with ex situ mineral carbonation, where the captured CO2 is stored in an inert and stable solid form after reacting with calcium and magnesium silicates. For a comprehensive assessment of the environmental and economic performance of this CO2 storage option in fossil-fueled power generation chains, life cycle assessment (LCA) and levelized cost of electricity (LCoE) calculations are performed. The implementation of CCS using mineral carbonation leads to life cycle GHG emission reductions of 15‚Äì64% and LCoE increases of 90‚Äì370% on a per kWhel basis compared to a reference power plant without CCS. The life cycle GHG emission reduction achievable with mineral sequestration is less substantial than with geological storage of CO2 due to significant energy and chemical additives requirements.

Work has centered on FGD gypsum or calcium sulfite and to a much lesser extent on fly ash. Researchers have found three agronomically valuable functions of these materials. First, and most obvious, is the fertilizer value of these materials. Gypsum applications to the soil surface provide the rainfall with an alternative source of electrolyte which prevents soil crushing, thus keeping the soil open and permeable to rainwater and air. Gypsum is more effective than liming materials atremediation of sub-soil acidity by detoxifying the excess exchangeable aluminium, which causes low pH. One proven way to sequester carbon is to fix it as organic matter in soil. 90% of the carbon in roots is converted to soil organic matter, whereas 90% of surface residue is oxide and the carbon returned to the atmosphere. Therefore, more carbon is sequestered by increasing root growth. Improved soil water management also reduces nitrous oxide emissions from soils.

Chrysotile has been extracted from the deposit intermittently between 1906 and 1983, producing 24.2 Mt of ultramafic tailings.  The tailings result from dry-grinding of chrysotile ore and are stored above ground on an area covering about 0.5 km2.

Extensive carbonate crusts have formed on the tailings pile since the closure of the mine.  Natural weathering dissolves Mg-silicate minerals present in the tailings and precipitates Mg-carbonate minerals in the form of crusts and cements.  Isotopic signatures of the carbonate minerals (Œ¥13C, Œ¥18O, F14C) indicate that carbonate crusts consisting of hydromagnesite predominantly incorporate CO2 of atmospheric origin.  Estimation of the carbonate content has shown that large amounts of CO2 have been sequestered in the tailings at Woodsreef at rates significantly elevated above the background CO2 uptake rate by chemical weathering of coherent silicate rocks.  There is potential to further enhance the rates of CO2 sequestration by optimizing the tailings storage for this purpose.  Natural weathering of ultramafic tailings thus represents a viable option for low-energy, low-cost sequestration of CO2, directly from the atmosphere.

Since the carbonation of mine tailings during weathering occurs in the aqueous phase additional information on the process can be unlocked by investigating the chemistry and isotopic composition of waters interacting with the tailings.  The isotopic composition of these waters also represents an intermediate step in the pathway of the sequestered carbon and can thus serves to better constrain isotopic fractionation during formation of hydrated Mg-carbonates in these settings.

Many environmental problems arise from these biogeochemical changes, including rising atmospheric CO2 and the degradation of the quality of land, air, and water. A mechanistic understanding of elemental interactions provides an opportunity for deliberate manipulations of elements in order to mitigate environmental problems. In this chapter we demonstrate that recoupling of elements can be a successful strategy for minimizing or alleviating the harmful effects of human activities and for restoring degraded ecosystems. There are two fundamentally different pathways by which elemental interactions can be manipulated to achieve environmental goals. The first is to limit the source of the excess elemental inputs (limiting primary forcing). Examples include decreasing the emissions of pollutants or greenhouse gases or minimizing the applications of fertilizers or other chemicals. A second approach is to minimize the effects of excess elements by introducing another change to counteract the undesirable effects of the primary forcing.

The pathway of possible recycling to the atmosphere of originally sequestered CO2 is via recycling to surface waters degassing CO2. This process is controlled by various variables, the most important being (1) the pH and dissolved carbon concentration of the infiltrating pore fluids and (2) the degree of CO2 supersaturation of the water courses that receive the pore fluids with increased pCO2.

This proposal was evaluated via three objectives: (1) synthesise literature studies documenting the effectiveness of geological minerals at mitigating GHG emissions; (2) quantify, via meta-analysis, GHG magnitudes that could be abated by minerals factoring-in the carbon footprint of the approach; and (3) estimate the global availability of relevant minerals. Several minerals have been effectively harnessed across multiple sectors‚Äîincluding agriculture, waste management and coal mining‚Äîto mitigate carbon dioxide/CO 2 (e.g., olivine), methane/CH 4 (e.g., allophane, gypsum) and nitrous oxide/N 2 O (e.g., vermiculite) emissions. High surface area minerals offer substantial promise to protect soil carbon, albeit their potential impact here is difficult to quantify. Although mineral-based N 2 O reduction strategies can achieve gross emission reduction, their application generates a net carbon emission due to prohibitively large mineral quantities needed. By contrast, mineral-based technologies could abate ~9% and 11% of global CO 2 and CH 4 anthropogenic emissions, respectively. These estimates conservatively only consider options which offer additional benefits to climate change mitigation (e.g., nutrient supply to agricultural landscapes, and safety controls in landfill operations). This multi-benefit aspect is important due to the reluctance to invest in stand-alone GHG mitigation technologies. Minerals that exhibit high GHG mitigation potential are globally abundant.

The effectiveness of liming treatments have often been assessed biologically through tree growth measurements, but microorganisms respond rapidly to changes in pH and nutrient availability, and would potentially provide early insights into forest recovery. However, the impact of liming on the soil microbiome is not well understood; understanding the impacts of liming on a micro as well as a macro level will help to determine whether liming is a good remediation strategy for Nova Scotia.

Precipitation of meta-stable calcium carbonates majorly contributes to the total CO2 uptake, accounting for 62‚Äì69 % and 78‚Äì87 % of the carbonates formed in 25 % soil-mortars and 50 % soil mortars. These are substantially higher compared to 40‚Äì50 % in the case of control mixes. The mentioned finding is attributed to the formation of additional calcium-silicate-hydrate and calcium-aluminate-hydrate due to clay-lime reaction, that binds CO2 and precipitate meta-stable polymorphs of calcium carbonate. Addition of lime and carbon sequestration are found to substantially enhance 1-day strength of cement-soil and cement-lime-soil mortars by 31‚Äì36 %, although no prominent effect at 7-day and 28-day marks are observed. Furthermore, capillary water absorption at 28-day age is reduced by 18‚Äì31 % in lime-added cement-soil mortars compared to the ones without lime, that reduces moisture sensitivity of the mortars. Overall, the carbon sequestered mortars demonstrate satisfactory strength (20‚Äì37 MPa) and water absorption performance of the stabilized mortars for masonry applications, which will provide a promising means to manufacture low-carbon and more durable construction products.",,tech|04,meth|01,cont|5,0.08,0.01,0.01,0.08,0.57,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.04,0.55,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.99,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170285,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

However, the benefit of liming in reducing soil greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) is conditioned by: (i) the evolution of the carbon of the calcium carbonates (CaCO3) supplied, and (ii) the effect of CaCO3 on the evolution of soil organic carbon (SOC). The literature presents contrasting effects of liming on inorganic- and SOC-derived CO2 emissions. Current understanding of the impact of liming on GHG emissions is limited by the lack of field data, and therefore requires further study.In situ, we monitored the effect of two liming products (SC = synthetic CaCO3 and MC = marine CaCO3) on soil CO2 emissions compared to control plots, during the growing season of a winter rye, using the static chamber method. Soil pH, N2O emissions, mineral nitrogen content, soil moisture and temperature were measured during the experiment, as well as plant biomass and SOC (stock and composition) on the day of harvest.Lime addition increased soil pH and kernel yield and significantly decreased soil CO2 emission with on average a reduction of 3.74 and 3.94 mg C kg-1 d-1, for the MC and SC addition respectively. SOC at harvest was not affected but its composition was modified by the limed treatments. Liming was also associated with a decrease in dissolved organic carbon losses in the soil. Further investigations must be carried out to better understand the mechanisms explaining these observations and to define conditions in which liming application could act as a potential lever for carbon storage. Finally, our results suggest that the IPCC principles, estimating an increase of CO2 emissions linked to the C added by lime materials, may need to be re-examined in the future.",,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.78,0.04,0.03,0.02,0.03,0.05,0.91,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.42,0.66,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4697199,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Most studies have been focused on investigating its dissolution rates by monitoring chemical effluent changes under various conditions. However, only by observation of surface reactivity can we unravel the actual mechanism (s) of dissolution. Here, we studied the dissolution of an olivine (010) plane in a flow-through reaction cell with an acidic solution, a surface-controlled regime, and far-from-equilibrium conditions. Direct mineral surface topography measurements using vertical scanning interferometry and atomic force microscopy allowed for quantitative analyses of the spatial and temporal changes in the dissolution rate. The (010) plane dissolved discontinuously in time for different surface sites, resulting in a heterogeneously distributed rate map. Pits with different depths showed opposite dissolution rate distributions from the dislocation center to further out from the etch pit. Based on the step-wave model, we propose a mechanism of dissolution that is governed by the competition between Gibbs free energy of the dissolution process, ŒîG, and the critical free energy of the opening of etch pits, i.e., ŒîGcrit. The migration of step waves, the distribution of surface defects, the strain field of etch pits, and other dynamic elements, resulting in the instantaneous change of ŒîGcrit on the surface, are important factors leading to the discontinuous dissolution of crystal materials.

After six months, the results showed that the application of carbonate did not induce a significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) in cocoa seedlings growth. However, the amended soil showed improvement chemical properties compared to unamended soil. Soil treatments with limestone improved soil base cation content, CEC and pH, but all these parameters measured still lower to minimum threshold values for good cocoa tree growth.

Therefore, small amounts of carbonate minerals have the potential to control the dissolved weathering loads in silicate-dominated catchments. Both weathering processes produce alkalinity under the consumption of CO2. Given that only alkalinity generation from silicate weathering is thought to be a long-term sink for CO2, a misattributed weathering source could lead to incorrect conclusions about long- and short-term CO2 fixation. In this study, we aimed to identify the weathering sources responsible for alkalinity generation and CO2 fixation across watershed scales in a degrading permafrost landscape in northern Norway, 68.7‚Äì70.5‚àò N, and on a temporal scale, in a subarctic headwater catchment on the mountainside of Iskorasfjellet, characterized by sporadic permafrost and underlain mainly by silicates as the alkalinity-bearing lithology. By analyzing total alkalinity (AT) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations, as well as the stable isotope signature of the latter (Œ¥13C-DIC), in conjunction with dissolved cation and anion loads, we found that AT was almost entirely derived from weathering of the sparse carbonate minerals. We propose that in the headwater catchment the riparian zone is a hotspot area of AT generation and release due to its enhanced hydrological connectivity and that the weathering load contribution from the uphill catchment is limited by insufficient contact time of weathering agents and weatherable materials. By using stable water isotopes, it was possible to explain temporal variations in AT concentrations following a precipitation event due to surface runoff. In addition to carbonic acid, sulfuric acid, probably originating from oxidation of pyrite or reduced sulfur in wetlands or from acid deposition, is shown to be a potential corrosive reactant. An increased proportion of sulfuric acid as a potential weathering agent may have resulted in a decrease in AT. Therefore, carbonate weathering in the studied area should be considered not only as a short-term CO2 sink but also as a potential CO2 source. Finally, we found that AT increased with decreasing permafrost probability, and attributed this relation to an increased water storage capacity associated with increasing contact of weathering agent and rock surfaces and enhanced microbial activity. As both soil respiration and permafrost thaw are expected to increase with climate change, increasing the availability of weathering agents in the form of CO2 and water storage capacity, respectively, we suggest that future weathering rates and alkalinity generation will increase concomitantly in the study area.",,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.04,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.78,0.04,0.02,0.01,0.03,0.03,0.01,0.98,0.02,0.01,0.07,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3459-2023,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

A challenge when working with solid waste‚Äìfluid reactions is that mass transfer limitations across solid‚Äìliquid, solid‚Äìgas, and gas‚Äìliquid interfaces and unfavorable thermodynamics lead to slow reaction rates, incomplete reaction conversions, high energy expenditure and processing costs, and inadequate product properties. The traditional macroscale approaches to overcoming slurry reaction limitations can be effective; however, they come at a cost to the environment. In the treatment or valorization of low-grade and waste resources, such conventional approaches are often unfeasible on an industrial scale. Sustainable solutions are thus needed.In the last six years, we have been exploring and developing approaches to overcoming reaction rate limitations of slurry reactions of environmental relevance by concurrently applying process intensification strategies and multiscale engineering approaches. The scientific approach has relied on laboratory-scale experiments to test and refine the devised multiscale process intensification strategies, with thermodynamic and computational modeling work supporting the experimental work and with advanced characterization techniques being used to elucidate reaction and transport mechanisms and aid the development of nanoscale reaction models and micro- and macroscale process models. The research streams, associated with the four key references, discussed next are (a) brine carbonation; (b) mineral carbonation and enhanced weathering; (c) process intensification and integration; and (d) characterization techniques.Within the four research streams, a number of mineral carbonation processes have been investigated and can be classified as (i) ambient weathering and carbonation; (ii) gas-(wet) solid accelerated carbonation; (iii) aqueous accelerated carbonation; (iv) supercritical accelerated carbonation; and (v) CO2 mineralization from brine. In some cases, the research was aimed at producing valuable products with reduced environmental risk or a reduced carbon footprint, such as an organomineral fertilizer and zeolites. In other cases, the aim was to assess the reactivity of minerals to match the right feedstock with the right carbonation process, in view of maximizing net carbon sequestration. There were also cases where the carbonation process was reimagined by the use of innovative reaction conditions, reactors, and reagents. The experience with accelerated weathering and carbonation in engineered processes has been translated into the field of enhanced rock weathering (ERW) in agriculture, where the multidisciplinary approach used has served to advance ERW science and technology in ways that have had a resounding effect on recent commercial deployment.The completed research serves to encourage the adoption of process intensification technologies in place of conventional processes, in industry and among the research community, and to catalyze the development of the types of sustainable processes required by the chemical, metallurgical, and minerals industries (which are critical to the green transition) to reduce their environmental impact and carbon emissions. Moreover, the multiscale process intensification approaches developed may also be extended to other industrial, urban, and agricultural processes where the reduction of energy intensity, carbon intensity, and environmental footprint could be achieved.",,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.15,0.01,0.02,0.21,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.76,0.03,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.06,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.94,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.3c00364,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

However, under good management practice it is possible to maintain and even re-accumulate SOC. We evaluated how different cropland management techniques affected SOC stocks in the topsoil (0‚Äì30 cm depth) of 10 long-term experiments (LTE) in Germany. We found that SOC stocks were particularly enhanced by mineral fertilization and organic amendments like straw incorporation and to a smaller degree by irrigation, but only slightly affected by the choice of preceding crops. In agreement with global meta-analyses, liming and reduced tillage had little or even negative effects on SOC storage, but effects also depended on fertilization. Management effects on SOC stocks were dependent on soil texture: sandy soils showed the lowest SOC stocks of 20.9 ¬± 2.3 (standard error of the mean) Mg ha‚àí1, but exhibited the largest relative response to different management options. Annual changes in SOC stocks ranged from ‚àí3.0 ‚Ä∞ with no mineral N fertilization, to + 6.1 ‚Ä∞ with farmyard manure application, using the mineral-fertilized and limed treatment as reference. Even higher rates of up to + 10.6 ‚Ä∞ yr‚àí1 were reached with the combination of irrigation and straw incorporation. Note that the contribution of organic amendments to SOC accrual and thus to climate change mitigation must be adjusted for reduction in SOC at sites from which straw was removed. Overall, the potential of agricultural management to influence and enhance SOC stocks is significant. This potential is controlled by soil type and land-use duration, is largest for sandy soils with overall lowest SOC stocks, and is characterized by antagonistic and synergistic effects of different management practices.",,tech|04,meth|03,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.89,0.04,0.03,0.02,0.03,0.05,0.82,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.43,0.02,0.01,0.8,0.02,0.02,0.04,0.03,0.03,0.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.99,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116616,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The model is forced by a stochastic rainfall, simulated as a marked Poisson process, and puts together the ecohydrology and the biogeochemistry. Plants influence the whole system with their evapotranspiration, nutrients uptake (Na&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; and Mg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) and the addition of organic matter to the soil. Biogeochemistry involves all the aspects of the model related to the cycle of the dissolved ions (H&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, Na&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; and Mg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;), litter decomposition and the chemical reaction of olivine with CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Running the model under different climate scenarios highlights that the highest olivine weathering rates are assessed under wet conditions. This happens because high soil moisture leads to higher reactive surface areas of particles and higher dissolution rates. This aspect is emphasized from the fact that soil pH is lower in humid than in dry environments and weathering reaction rates are higher in acid conditions since hydrogen ions are the reactants of many weathering reactions. The study also attempts to evaluate the economic feasibility of the intervention in agricultural fields. Apart from the costs of performing this kind of intervention, some benefits should be taken into account. More specifically, spreading olivine on agricultural fields leads to an increase of Na&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, Ca&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; and Mg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; concentrations, thus a certain amount of olivine can replace the addition of fertilizers. Therefore, this study proposes a natural solution for facing climate change problems and presents a model that could be used as a decision support system in land management.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.44,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.91,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.05,0.01,0.63,0.01,0.01,0.07,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-gc8-hydro-5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

A photosynthetic biofilm suspension (20L), sourced from the Venetia diamond mine (Limpopo, South Africa) pit wall, was cultured in 3 √ó 1000 L bioreactors using BG-11 medium. Bioreactors supplemented with Fine Residue Deposit (FRD) kimberlite material enhanced microbial growth and kimberlite weathering. This (ca. 1.44 kg) wet weight bio-amendment corresponded to ca. 1.5 √ó 109Acidithiobacillus spp. sized bacteria/g CRD (20 kg FRD growth supplement +60 kg FRD used for harvesting biomass +850 kg CRD used in the field trial experiment). This bio-amendment promoted carbonate precipitation and subsequent cementation under surface conditions (0-20 cm). Microbial inoculation accelerated pedogenesis of CRD materials. A soil-like substrate resulted from weathering under environmental conditions in Johannesburg from January 2020 to April 2021. Over this 15-month experiment, the biodiversity found in the inoculum shifted due to the selective pressure of the kimberlite. The natural, endogenous biosphere, when combined with the inoculum, accelerated carbonate precipitation in the upper 20 cm of the bioreactor by between +1 wt% and + 2 wt%. Conversely, carbonation of the bioreactor at depth (20-40 cm) decreased by ca. 1 wt%. All the secondary carbonate observed in the bioreactors was biogenic in nature, i.e., possessing microbial fossils. This secondary carbonate took the form of both radiating acicular crystals as well as colloform intergranular cements. This microbial inoculum and resulting geochemical changes promoted the transformation of kimberlite into a Technosol, capable of supporting the germination and growth of self-seeding, windblown grasses, which enhanced weathering in the rhizosphere.

The soil depth to which agricultural management practices affect SOC is uncertain. Soil depth may have an important bearing on soil carbon dynamics, so it is important to consider depth effects to capture fully changes in SOC stocks. This applies in particular to the evaluation of carbon farming measures, which are becoming increasingly important due to climate change. We sampled and analysed the upper metre of mineral cropland soils from ten long-term experiments (LTEs) in Germany to quantify depth-specific effects on SOC stocks of common agricultural management practices: mineral nitrogen (N) fertilisation, a combination of N, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilisation, irrigation, a crop rotation with preceding crops (pre-crops), straw incorporation, application of farmyard manure (FYM), liming, and reduced tillage. In addition, the effects of soil compaction on SOC stocks were examined as a negative side effect of agricultural management. Results showed that 19 ¬± 3 % of total management effects on SOC stocks were found in the upper subsoil (30‚Äì50 cm) and 3 ¬± 4 % in the lower subsoil (50‚Äì100 cm), including all agricultural management practices with significant topsoil SOC effects, while 79 ¬± 7 % of management effects were in the topsoil (0‚Äì30 cm). Nitrogen and NPK fertilisation were the treatments that had the greatest effect on subsoil organic carbon (OC) stocks, followed by irrigation, FYM application and straw incorporation. Sampling down to a depth of 50 cm resulted in significantly higher SOC effects than when considering topsoil only. A crop rotation with pre-crops, liming, reduced tillage and soil compaction did not significantly affect SOC stocks at any depth increment. Since approximately 20 % of the impact of agricultural management on SOC stocks occurs in the subsoil, we recommend soil monitoring programs and carbon farming schemes extend their standard soil sampling down to 50 cm depth to capture fully agricultural management effects on SOC.",,tech|04,meth|00,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.95,0.03,0.02,0.02,0.03,0.05,0.63,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.98,0.02,0.01,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.99,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2023.108619,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The economic concern of the direct aqueous CO2 mineralization prevents the application to global warming mitigation. This work discovers that the CO2 mineralization of olivine can be significantly enhanced by using nitriloacetate (NTA) salt due to the competitive complexation and extraction of nickel and cobalt versus carbonate precipitation. The highly selective critical metal extraction can be also achieved and even considerably enhanced by using NTA compared to using ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) salt. Nearly 90% CO2 mineralization, nickel and cobalt extraction can be achieved and is suitable for both nickel-poor olivine and nickel-rich saprolite and limonite laterites. The recovery of nickel and cobalt makes the CO2 mineralization process favourable in both economics and technical outcome. The enhanced CO2 mineralization process can potentially earn $29, $557, and $221 net benefits for each t olivine, saprolite, and limonite, respectively.

In this chapter, we show that, despite the great advances in soil managementSoil management and productivity gains for most cash crops, Brazil still needs to increase the crop productivity for key staple foods, due to limited investments in soil fertilization and liming, both below the recommended amount for a successful production. Also, low pasture productivity due to a long-term extractive exploitation model is one of the main causes of widespread soil and pastureland degradation in Brazil. The management of nutrient fertilizers in Brazil is summarized here, highlighting the high dependency we have for imports of most products. The production and use of organomineral fertilizers has grown significantly in Brazil during the last decade, compared with the increasing rates of mineral fertilizers. The use of crushed rocks as fertilizer alternatives, raise many questions about the short-term nutrient availability and supply, low efficiency, and little residual effect. On the other hand, many advances were made in Biological N2 fixation and associations with mycorrhizal fungi for many different crops. Long-term studies of areas under intense soil managementSoil management and fertilization showed a good legacy of improved soil fertility status under technified management, particularly in the Brazilian Cerrados. Also, the potential mitigation of the greenhouse effect by appropriate soil managementSoil management and environmental conservation issues, are highlighted in this review. The adequate use and management of plant nutrients through balanced fertilization can significantly increase the carbon sequestration potential, since more productive crops tend to increase soil organic carbon levels and atmospheric CO2 sequestration, besides reducing the pressure for further deforestation and expansion of cultivated land. In the closing section, we show that after incorporating deep weatheredDeep weathered soils clay soils (LatosolsLatosol) under Cerrado into highly productive systems, Brazil now incorporates extensive areas of sandy and medium texture soils of very low fertility into intensive systems, based on heavy fertilization and the adoption of management practices with a conservationist bias.

Generally, in dryland regions, high evapotranspiration along with moisture deficient situation promotes formation of SIC. Apart from its (SIC) potential as atmospheric CO2 sink, it may play an indirect positive role in soil aggregation through the interaction between carbonates and soil organic matter. During the amelioration of sodic soils in dryland regions, SIC acts as a modifier or ecosystem engineer. Anthropogenic activities including unsustainable land use practices and injudicious use of water are the major driving forces for increasing the coverage of global dry lands. The largest accumulation of carbonates occurs in the soils of arid and semiarid areas because of the conducive environment created under dryland ecosystem due to calcification and formation of secondary carbonates. As a result, SIC plays an important role in soil C sequestration and global C cycle. Soil erosion and arid conditions coupled with climate change (drought and heat waves) are posing challenges to dry lands, which strongly influence the carbon cycle due to erosion-induced loss of carbon. Therefore, to unlock the potential of dryland SIC and climate change mitigation, desertification must be controlled to achieve land degradation neutrality.",,tech|04,meth|05,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.86,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.72,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.9,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.06,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-9159-2_14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Whilst the majority of these sediments have the potential to be used in nature-based environmental management projects, there are concerns that the oxidation of these sediments will release greenhouse gases and contaminants to the environment.The idea of spreading ground olivine in terrestrial and coastal environments to capture CO2 is becoming increasingly popular due to the urgency to combat climate change. This technique (termed artificially enhanced olivine weathering, EOW) capitalizes on the natural process of olivine weathering that encourages gaseous CO2 to transform into dissolved bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). &amp;#160;In addition, the dissolution of olivine increases soil water pH and allows precipitation of secondary minerals (e.g. Fe oxyhydroxides) that can immobilize toxic metals through adsorption and co-precipitation mechanisms. As a result, EOW could be a promising geo-engineering solution for sediment management at PoR and reduce the negative environmental impacts associated with dredging. However, the specific controls on the drawdown of CO2 and toxic metal dynamics via silicate weathering are not well constrained.Through laboratory experiments and field trials, we aim to investigate whether the addition of various commercial olivine-rich mineral mixtures (Greensand, Sibelco sand, etc.) can transform the dredged material from the PoR into a sustainable resource. Several bulk sediment and intact core samples, representing the majority of sediment supplied to the Slufter, were collected from the fluvial stretch of the PoR area. Laboratory batch experiments using artificial seawater were conducted for 90 days (at 1 bar and 12oC) with (1) only fine-grained (10 &amp;#8211; 30 &amp;#956;m) Greensand containing ~62 weight-% forsteritic olivine, 2) only fluvial harbor sediment, and 3) mixtures of Greensand and fluvial harbor sediment. Our results show that olivine dissolution caused significant increases in alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and seawater-pH. Nickel concentrations in the aqueous phase remained below the environmental standards in most of the experiments and only slightly exceeded the standard value in experiments with the highest solid/liquid ratio. Furthermore, the mobilization of toxic metals like Zn and Mn from the harbor sediment to the solution was limited in the olivine-sediment mixed experiments, most likely due to adsorption with olivine or with precipitated byproducts of olivine dissolution. Scanning Electron Microscopy / Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) analysis of the reacted olivine samples shows the presence of Ca carbonates precipitation but no clear evidence of Mg carbonates or secondary Mg silicate phases (in contrast to results from thermodynamic calculations using PHREEQC). &amp;#173;Overall, these preliminary laboratory findings indicate that EOW applications in PoR are likely to be viable from an environmental geochemical point-of-view, but further testing in long-term experiments and field trials planned in the project will provide a more accurate assessment.",,tech|11,meth|01,cont|5,0.05,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.62,0.99,0.02,0.02,0.05,0.03,0.01,0.1,0.92,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-10281,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Guizhou accounted for 1.8% of the land area and contributed 5.4% of the carbonate chemical weathering carbon sink; (2) the silicate rock chemical weathering carbon sink and its flux were 1.44 √ó 103 t CO2 and 2.43 t CO2 km-2 yr-1, respectively; (3) the vegetation-soil ecosystem carbon sink and its flux were 1.37 √ó 108 t CO2 and 831.70 t CO2 km-2 yr-1, respectively; (4) the carbon emissions (CEs) were 280 Tg CO2, about 2.8% of the total for China; and (5) the total carbon sinks in Guizhou were 160 Tg CO2, with a CNCI of 57%, which is 4.8 times of China and 2.1 times of the world. In summary, we conducted a systematic diagnosis of the CNC considering the RCS and established a CNCI model.

New Zealand‚Äôs average annual temperature has risen by 1.13 degrees Celsius from 1909 to 2019 [1]. As a result, the level of sea is rising and adverse changes such as extreme rainfall, drought, increasing hunger and poor nutrition are beginning to emerge. Statistics show that the transport sector produces a considerable amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually. In New Zealand, road transport made up 43% of gross CO2 emission in 2018 and improving the engine technology was not effective [1]. Olivine is an easily accessible mineral that is found all over the earth‚Äôs mantle. Under natural conditions, 1 kg of Olivine can absorb about 1 kg of CO2 [2]. For optimal absorption, Olivine stone needs to be pulverised. Magnesium silicate in the stone reacts with water and CO2 to form bicarbonate that captures CO2 in a solid form. In addition to taking up CO2, Olivine has the potential to stabilise the soil sustainably through alkaline activation. New Zealand has 83,000 km of local roads and 11,000 km of state highways that have the potential to sequester CO2 not only in roads but also in the roadside area. Initial calculations show that the unsealed roads of New Zealand have the potential to absorb about 100,000 tonnes of CO2 annually. This study is a review paper that summarizes the recent progress in the field of sustainable roads. This presentation aims to evaluate the feasibility of using Olivine in road construction to stabilise the soil and calculate the potential of CO2 absorption in New Zealand to take a step toward the Climate Change Response (Zero-Carbon) Amendment Act 2019 and considerations concerning kaitiakitanga (guardianship).",,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.26,0.0,0.02,0.18,0.07,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.57,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.05,0.01,0.95,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.98,,https://doi.org/10.24135/rangahau-aranga.v1i3.120,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

It consists on accelerating the chemical weathering fluxes naturally occurring in soils, by means of the addition of silicate minerals (i.e., &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;forsterite&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;), used as amendments, to the soil. If crushed into micrometer-sized particles, these minerals are characterized by high dissolution rates, that may be further improved under high soil water content and low pH conditions. Before actually applying EW technique at the global scale for carbon sequestration, an in-depth characterization of weathering and carbon sequestration rates, under different environmental conditions, is needed, also looking at correlated beneficial/detrimental effects. In this context, modeling approaches may play a pivotal role, since they allow to achieve this goal without affording costs required by laboratory and field experiments. The present study describes the application of a dynamic mass balance model connecting ecohydrological, biogeochemical and olivine dissolution dynamics. The model is composed of four connected components and is solved through an explicit system of eight mass balance total differential equations and an implicit one having 22 algebraic equations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this study, the model is applied to two sites in Italy (i.e., Sicily, in the south and the Padan plain, in the north) and two in the USA (i.e., California, in the south-west and Iowa, in the north-central area). The most common crops for the case studies, i.e., wheat for Sicily and California and corn for the Padan plain and Iowa are here considered, along with the most frequent soil types, namely the clay loam for Sicily and California and the silty clay loam for the Padan plain and Iowa.

Most of the studies of biomineralization are carried out at a normal pressure. However, several practical application fields are in high-pressure environmental conditions, which affect treatment effects. In this study, a new high-pressure research apparatus has been constructed and used to provide a maximum confining pressure of 20 bar for sand solidification. In addition, the N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) addition was proposed to improve the solidification homogeneity at higher pressures. The formed sand columns demonstrated the feasibility of the constructed apparatus for high-pressure sand solidification. The permeabilities of EICP or EICP-NBPT treated specimens both decreased during the treatment regardless of different confining pressures. The increase of confining pressure decreased pore sizes, eventually leading to smaller CaCO3 contents in specimens. With the confining pressure increasing from 0 to 12 bar, the increasing rate of strength for the sample with EICP treatment was 75%, while decreased to 35% and 12% at 16 bar and 20 bar, respectively. The NBPT addition resulted in smaller differences of sonic time values and CaCO3 contents at different parts, achieving higher strengths. The sample with EICP-NBPT treatment had the largest strength at 16 bar. In this study, the difference of strength was attributed to the combined effects of solidification homogeneity and confining pressure. The results demonstrated that the EICP or EICP-NBPT treatments in this study had several promising applications potentials: improving wellbore integrity, reducing near-wellbore pressure loss, and enhancing CO2 sequestration, which benefit the petroleum industry.",,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.08,0.01,0.01,0.12,0.21,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.58,0.01,0.0,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.99,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2022.110787,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Fast pyrolyzers thermally transform biomass into bio-oil, syngas, and charcoal. The syngas could provide the energy needs of the pyrolyzer. Bio-oil is an energy raw material (‚àº17 MJ kg‚àí1) that can be burned to generate heat or shipped to a refinery for processing into transportation fuels. Charcoal could also be used to generate energy; however, application of the charcoal co-product to soils may be key to sustainability. Application of charcoal to soils is hypothesized to increase bioavailable water, build soil organic matter, enhance nutrient cycling, lower bulk density, act as a liming agent, and reduce leaching of pesticides and nutrients to surface and ground water. The half-life of C in soil charcoal is in excess of 1000 yr. Hence, soil-applied charcoal will make both a lasting contribution to soil quality and C in the charcoal will be removed from the atmosphere and sequestered for millennia. Assuming the United States can annually produce 1.1 √ó 109 Mg of biomass from harvestable forest and crop lands, national implementation of The Charcoal Vision would generate enough bio-oil to displace 1.91 billion barrels of fossil fuel oil per year or about 25% of the current U.S. annual oil consumption.

Here a comprehensive hydro-biogeochemical model has been applied to four cropland case studies (i.e., Sicily and the Padan plain in Italy and California and Iowa in the USA) characterized by different rainfall seasonality, vegetation (i.e., wheat for Sicily and California and corn for Padan plain and Iowa), and soil type to explore their influence on dissolution rates. The results reveal that rainfall seasonality, and irrigation when applied, are crucial in determining EW and carbon sequestration dynamics, given their effect on hydrological fluxes, soil pH, and weathering rate. The carbon sequestration rate was found to be strongly affected also by the pre-EW soil pH, which is one of the main factors controlling soil pH before the olivine amendment.

However, both microbial acclimation and evolution in such manipulated natural environments are often overlooked, yet they are of great importance for understanding the biological consequences of whether olivine addition is a feasible approach to mitigating climate change. In this study, an olivine addition experiment was conducted to investigate variation in bacterial diversity and community composition in the surface and bottom seawater of a representative marine ranch area in the Muping, Yantai. The results show that the composition of the particle-attached microbial community was particularly affected by the application of olivine. The relative abundance of biofilm-forming microbes in particle-attached fraction increased after the addition of olivine, while no significant variation in the free-living bacterial community was observed. Our study suggests that olivine addition would reshape the bacterial community structure, especially in particle-attached microenvironments. Therefore, the risk evaluation of alkalinity enhancement should be further studied before its large-scale application as a potential ocean geoengineering plan.",,tech|11,meth|00,cont|5,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.52,0.99,0.02,0.04,0.11,0.02,0.01,0.96,0.04,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.805361,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The objective of the present study was to clarify how such soil amendments affect the mineralization of soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in allophanic Andosols under different temperature regimes. The soil was treated using combinations of liming and heavy phosphate application, followed by incubation under different temperature conditions. The N mineralization and the soil CO2 evolution rate were measured periodically. The patterns of N mineralization were analyzed by fitting them to first-order kinetics. Liming increased C and N mineralization irrespective of temperature, and the increase was further enhanced by phosphate application. Kinetic analysis of the N mineralization curve indicated lowering of the activation energy of N mineralization reactions with phosphate application, suggesting that P application may accelerate N mineralization at lower temperatures.

In this work, the potential of using two Canadian natural silicates for accelerated carbonation is experimentally assessed: kimberlite mine tailing (Mg0.846Al0.165Fe0.147Ca0.067SiO3.381) from the Northwest Territories, and mined wollastonite ore (Ca0.609Mg0.132Al0.091Fe0.024SiO2.914) from Ontario. The aim of this work was to evaluate the weathering reactivity and CO2 uptake capacity via carbonation of these two comminuted rocks, both of which are made up of a mixture of alkaline minerals, under process conditions that spanned from milder to intensified. Research questions addressed include: does kimberlite contain a sufficient amount of reactive minerals to act as an effective carbon sink; is dehydroxylation necessary to activate kimberlite, and to what extent does it do this; do secondary phases of wollastonite hinder its reactivity; and can either of these minerals be carbonated without pH buffering, or only weathered? Incubator, slurry, and pressurized slurry methods of accelerated weathering and carbonation were used, and the effect of the process parameters (temperature, solid-to-liquid ration, reaction time, CO2 level, pH buffer) on the CO2 uptake and crystalline carbonates formation is tested. The reacted samples were analyzed by pH test, loss-on-ignition test, calcimeter test, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Results showed that wollastonite ore (rich in fast-weathering CaSiO3) is more suitable for accelerated carbonation than kimberlite tailing (containing slow-weathering hydrated magnesium silicates and aluminosilicates) when only its capability to rapidly form solid carbonates is considered. Incubator and pressurized buffered slurry methods proved to be most effective as under these conditions the precipitation of carbonates was more favorable, while the unbuffered slurry reaction conditions were more akin to accelerated weathering rather than accelerated carbonation.",,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.3390/cryst11121584,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In this context, the application of biocrusts is a promising framework with which to increase SOC and other soil functions in the soil-plant continuum. Despite the importance of biocrusts, their application to agriculture is limited due to: (1) competition with native microbiota, (2) difficulties in applying them on a large scale, (3) a lack of studies based on carbon (C) balance and suitable for model parameterization, and (4) a lack of studies evaluating the contribution of biocrust weathering to increase C sequestration. Considering these four challenges, we propose three perspectives for biocrust application: (1) natural microbiome engineering by a host plant, using biocrusts; (2) quantifying the contribution of biocrusts to C sequestration in soils; and (3) enhanced biocrust weathering to improve C sequestration.

However, the link between primary mineral weathering, poorly crystalline minerals, and soil carbon has not been fully tested, particularly at large spatial scales. To close this knowledge gap, we designed a model that links primary mineral weathering rates to the geographic distribution of poorly crystalline minerals across the USA, and then used this model to evaluate the effect of rock weathering on soil organic carbon. We found that poorly crystalline minerals are most abundant and most strongly correlated with organic carbon in geographically limited zones that sustain enhanced weathering rates, where humid climate and abundant primary minerals co-occur.

Techniques are thus needed to sequester and reduce atmospheric carbon. One of the proposed techniques is the transformation or construction of new soils into which more organic carbon can be sequestered and CO2 be consumed by increased weathering. By using a chronosequence of new and transformed soils on crushed limestone (0‚Äì48 years) in a Mediterranean area (Sicily), we tried to quantify the amount of organic carbon that could be additionally sequestered and to derive the corresponding rates. A further aim was to trace chemical weathering and related CO2 consumption and the evolution of macropores that are relevant for water infiltration and plant nutrition. Owing to the irrigation of the table grape cultivation, the transformed soils developed fast. After about 48 years, the organic C stocks were near 12 kg m‚àí2. The average org. C sequestration rates varied between 68 and 288 g m‚àí2 yr‚àí1. The C accumulation rates in the transformed soils are very high at the beginning and tend to decrease over (modelled) longer time scales. Over these 48 years, a substantial amount of carbonate was leached and reprecipitated as secondary carbonates. The proportion of secondary carbonates on the total inorganic carbon was up to 50%. Main mineralogical changes included the formation of interstratified clay minerals, the decrease of mica and increase of chloritic components as well as goethite. The atmospheric CO2 consumption due to silicate weathering was in the range of about 44‚Äì72 g C m‚àí2 yr‚àí1. Due to the high variability, the contribution of chemical weathering to CO2 consumption represents only an estimate. When summing up organic C sequestration and CO2 consumption by silicate weathering, rates in the order of 110‚Äì360 g C m‚àí2 yr‚àí1 are obtained. These are very high values. We estimated that high sequestration and CO2 consumption rates are maintained for about 50‚Äì100 years after soil transformation. The macropore volume decreased over the observed time span to half (from roughly 10 to 5 %). The transformation of soils may even amend their characteristics and increase agricultural production. Due to the relatively sandy character, enough macropores were present and no substantial compaction of the soils occurred. However, great caution has to be taken as such measures can trigger deterioration of both soil ecosystem services and soil quality.",,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.83,0.03,0.04,0.02,0.03,0.06,0.85,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.95,0.01,0.02,0.3,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115355,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In doing so, not only the total quantity of SOC but also the stability of SOC must be considered. Stability of SOC increases as a function of resistance to microbial decomposition or microbial substrate use efficiency through chemical, biological, and physical mechanisms including humification, hydrophobic moieties, molecular diversity, and formation of macroaggregates. One of the mechanisms that enhance stability confers changes in the distribution of C functional groups of SOM. To better understand and quantify how these changes are influenced by agricultural management practices, we collected 670 pairwise data from the body of literature that has evaluated changes in the distribution of C functional groups of SOM measured by solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy. The types of agricultural managements discussed herein include (1) fertilization, (2) tillage, (3) crop rotation, (4) grazing, and (5) liming practices. Our meta-analyses show that these practices modify the distribution of C functional groups of SOM. Fertilization practices were associated with increased O-alkyl groups. Tillage resulted in increases in the SOC consisted of aromatic and carbonyl groups. Crop rotations, especially legume-based rotations, were found to increase the proportion of aromatic groups. Although there are fewer publications on tillage and crop rotation than on fertilization practices, the distribution of C functional groups may be more influenced by crop rotation and tillage practices than fertilization management-and should be a focus of future research.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00374-021-01580-2.",,tech|04,meth|03,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00374-021-01580-2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Mineral weathering in soils is expected to promote chemical and physical interactions between soil organic matter and mineral phases. These interactions are known to enhance the protection of organic matter from decomposition. The investigation of the mineral-organic associations (MOA) formation mechanisms during weathering is therefore crucial to understand carbon storage processes in soils. Until now studies have been mainly conducted through laboratory experiments in simplified and controlled conditions or over very long-term time scales using pedosequences. But knowledge about MOA formation processes occurring in situ is lacking, notably during the first stage of mineral weathering.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To fill this gap, we performed a mesh bag incubation of large Na-saturated vermiculite particles (100-200 &amp;amp;#181;m in size) in a Typic Dystrochrept soil of a Douglas-fir forest, in the Beaujolais area (France). The incubated particles were deposited at the interface under the forest floor. After 20 years, the weathered vermiculite particles were collected and characterized at the macro-scale (XRD and physico-chemical analysis), at the micro-scale (Scanning Electron Microscopy &amp;amp;#8211; SEM, imaging and element mapping) and at the nano-scale (Transmission Electron Microscopy - TEM imaging, element mapping and speciation).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cation exchange capacity, exchangeable cations and elemental analysis showed significant differences between the mineral structures of the initial (V0) and 20 year incubated (V20) vermiculite particles. The exchangeable Na was completely depleted. Cation exchange capacity strongly decreased in V20 (49.2 cmol&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;c&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; kg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) compared to V0 (173.6 cmol&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;c&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; kg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;). The V20 lost its specific interlayer collapsing property (&amp;amp;#8776;1.4 -&amp;gt; &amp;amp;#8776;1.0 nm) with K saturation. V20 interlayer collapsing was only observed with a 330&amp;amp;#176;C heating treatment, suggesting the interlayer hydroxylation of vermiculite. High sheet dissolution, around 10%, was also observed. All these changes were attributed to chemical weathering, during which total C analysis showed significant enrichment in V20 (5.7 mg g&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) compared to V0 (0.8 mg g&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Macro, micro and nano-scale images and elemental mapping of V0 particles showed a highly flat, smooth surface morphology with no detected C. In contrast, V20 particles showed irregular outer and inner surfaces marked by multiple cracks of chemical dissolution. We also observed internal nano-sized exfoliation spaces filled with C and enriched in Ca, and micro-sized exfoliation spaces filled with C entrapped in nano-crystalline Mn oxides or K-rich aluminosilicates precipitates. The nature of the organic matter found strongly differed between small and large exfoliation spaces. It was characterized by alcohol, carboxyl functional groups and C=C bonds in small exfoliation spaces, while the obtained EELS spectra were more difficult to interpret in large exfoliations spaces. These results provide new evidence that over 20 years in situ weathering induces a significant dissolution, among other physical and chemical changes in large vermiculite particles. They reveal that the mineral weathering processes are responsible for the organic matter entrapment (i) in the newly formed mineral nano-sized spaces, possibly mediated by Ca, and (ii) in association with secondary minerals deposits in micro-sized spaces.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.78,0.04,0.03,0.02,0.04,0.03,0.85,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.64,0.52,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-9867,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Studies on climate change mitigation have focused entirely on soil organic carbon (SOC) to increase C sequestration and decrease carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In contrast, the contribution of soil inorganic carbon (SIC) to CO2 emissions is usually neglected because SIC is generally considered to be very stable. However, the significant worldwide increase in soil acidification, mainly because of intensive N fertilization and high atmospheric deposition, causes a considerable decrease in SIC stocks, leading to very high unaccounted CO2 efflux. Additionally, large areas of acidic soils worldwide are regularly subjected to high SIC applications in the form of lime to remediate acidity, which is another direct source of CO2 emission. Consequently, global efforts to mitigate climate change through SOC sequestration need a revisit as SIC-borne C losses are significant both in terms of C stocks and soil fertility loss, upon which future SOC sequestration will be reduced. Compared to SOC, wherein C stocks can be increased through management, SIC losses are irreversible and cause significant decline in soil health, ecosystem services, and functions. The present review is the first to summarize the current information about acidification-induced intensified SIC losses and their mechanisms. It included: (i) natural and anthropogenic sources and causes of soil acidification, (ii) losses of SIC as HCO3‚àí leaching and CO2 efflux from calcareous soils (7.5 Tg C yr‚àí1) and liming (273 Tg C yr‚àí1) during acidity neutralization, (iii) the relationship between climate change and SIC stocks, (iv) consequences of SIC depletion in soil-plant-water systems, and (v) strategies to remediate and control soil acidification. We concluded that acidification-induced SIC-borne CO2 losses are a major C loss pathway and could jeopardize global efforts to mitigate climate change through SOC sequestration.",,tech|04,meth|05,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128036,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The &amp;amp;#8220;enhanced weathering&amp;amp;#8221; of silicate rock has also gained recent interest in the scientific community for its potential to mitigate climate change. However, the effect of rock powder on the soil physical properties remains unclear, especially under climate change (e.g., increasing drought events). Prior to any large scale application of rock powder, it is crucial to disentangle the potential effects of rock powder application on its environment. In a mesocosm experiment, we explored the effect of three rock powders on plant biomass, soil aggregation and organic carbon (OC) allocation within aggregates, in two soils with clayey and sandy textures, under regular watering or severe drought conditions. We demonstrate that the rock powder was the third factor after drought and soil texture significantly affecting the plant growth, resulting in a significant plant biomass decrease ranging from - 13 % to - 42 % compared with the control. We mainly attribute this effect to the increase of the already neutral soil pH, along with the release of excessive heavy metal amounts at a toxic range for the plant. Yet, we found that adding rock powder to the soil resulted in an increase of the relative amount of microaggregates in the soil by up to + 70 %, along with a re-distribution of OC within the fine fractions of the soil (up to + 32 % of OC in &amp;lt; 250 &amp;amp;#181;m fractions). The new mineral-mineral and organo-mineral interactions promoted by the rock powder addition could potentially favour OC persistence in soil on the long term. With our results, we insist on the potential risks for plant growth associated to the application of rock powder when not handled properly. In addition to the current enthusiasm around the capacity of rock powder to enhance carbon sequestration in the inorganic form, we also encourage scientists to focus their research on its effect on soil structure properties and OC storage.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.54,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.9,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.81,0.43,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-4512,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Clarifying the mechanism would help in the development of new methods for soil carbon storage, such as in agricultural systems. We grew high-biomass forage rice cultivars for 11 years under conditions of potassium and silicic acid deficiency. Rice cultivars were healthy, without signs of potassium or silicic acid deficiency. The quantities of potassium and silicic acid absorbed by the rice plants were greater than those of available forms in the soil, fertilizer, and irrigation water, indicating that mineral weathering promoted the release of potassium, silicic acid, and aluminum from primary minerals. Furthermore, the carbon bound to active aluminum increased by 69.4 kg C ha‚àí1 year‚àí1 during 11 years of paddy rice cultivation. Although organic acids secreted by rice roots have been expected to be a factor in the strong mineral weathering effect in the rhizosphere, an only extremely small amount of organic acids were detected from rice roots. Therefore, organic acids are not a factor in promoting mineral weathering. On the other hand, leaching of potassium and silicic acid is observed in the contact reaction between the mineral powder and the cell wall prepared from rice root. These findings show that the primary minerals could be reacted with chelating sites on the cell wall of the rice root surface to dissolve potassium, aluminum, and silicic acid. The rice plants absorb potassium and a large amount of silicic acid under potassium and silicic acid deficient conditions. Then, the highly active aluminum remained in the rhizosphere, where it bound to organic matter, producing persistent soil carbon. Plants that can absorb silicic acid vigorously have a role of increasing active aluminum through mineral weathering, resulting contribute to carbon accumulation in soil.",,tech|04,meth|01,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2021.1878471,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Plant growth and nutrient cycling are known to respond positively to the addition of lime to decrease soil acidity. However, the interactions between liming and soil carbon dynamics remain incompletely understood. The nexus of soils, food security and climate change make this topic an urgent concern for investigation. This study utilised soils (Cambisols) from three long-term lime field trials (13-39 years) on farms. Soils (0-10 cm) were incubated in the laboratory for 3 months with and without 13C-labelled wheat crop residue. This approach enabled direct quantification of the CO2-C originating from three different processes; decomposition of extant soil organic carbon (SOC), decomposition of the added crop residue, and SOC priming i.e. the additional decomposition of SOC stimulated by addition of plant material. Biological and chemical soil properties were also quantified, with a novel application of measurement of the abundance of the functional genes involved in SOC decomposition. Priming was significantly increased in limed soils (P<0.01). The abundance of both archaeal rRNA genes, and the laccase-like functional gene involved in lignin decomposition correlated significantly and positively with SOC priming (Rho 0.46, P<0.01). Decomposition of extant SOC was positively correlated with pH and N (Rho 0.65, P<0.001). Decomposition of the added crop residue was also correlated with pH and inorganic N, albeit less strongly than for SOC (Rho 0.43, P< 0.05). These results support the theory that the application of lime to ameliorate soil acidity improves conditions for soil microorganisms as well as for plants. Archaea, and organisms harbouring SOC-decomposing laccases, would appear to play a key role in releasing nutrients stored in extant SOC, when priming is prompted by the addition of new plant material.

As crop and plant growth are significantly hampered under acidic soil conditions, many farmers, but increasingly as well forest managers, apply lime to raise the soil pH. Besides its direct effect on soil pH, liming also affects soil C and nutrient cycles and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. In this meta‚Äêanalysis, we reviewed 1570 observations reported in 121 field‚Äêbased studies worldwide, to assess liming effects on soil GHG fluxes and plant productivity. We found that liming significantly increases crop yield by 36.3%. Also, soil organic C (SOC) stocks were found to increase by 4.51% annually, though soil respiration is stimulated too (7.57%). Moreover, liming was found to reduce soil N 2 O emission by 21.3%, yield‚Äêscaled N 2 O emission by 21.5%, and CH 4 emission and yield‚Äêscaled CH 4 emission from rice paddies by 19.0% and 12.4%, respectively.

However, this comes at the cost of an additional CO 2 release (c. 624‚Äì656 Tg CO 2 year ‚àí1 ) deriving from lime mining, transport and application, and lime dissolution, so that the overall GHG balance is likely neutral. Nevertheless, liming of acid agricultural soils will increase yields by at least 6.64 √ó 10 8 Mg year ‚àí1 , covering the food supply of 876 million people.

In view of this, there is growing research into potential CO2 sequestration methods that can be implemented as climate mitigation strategies. One such option, which has been reported as a credible mechanism is Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW); a form of global carbon sequestration which involves the spreading of crushed silicate rocks on lands to speed up
the removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Despite the potential of ERW, there is limited understanding of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) supply chain sustainability implications of ERW which encompasses economic, environmental, and social impacts and these remain an important but underexplored research area. Consequently, providing a robust theoretical base and developing a quantitative supply chain modelling framework for analysing and understanding the TBL implications of ERW have become timely and important.

To address the aforementioned issues, this research adopts a quantitative research approach based on the methodological principle of supply chain TBL (economic, environmental, and social) impact assessments to address the pertinent questions surrounding ERW sustainability. For the environmental quantitative analysis, environmentally extended input-output and process life cycle analyses are used separately for estimating impacts across a range of comprehensive and integrated indicators. The economic assessment of ERW is done by way of performing macro-level lifecycle costing of silicate production using economic input-output model. Social implications of the ERW process such as labour rights and human
rights issues are assessed using a socially extended input-output method based on the social hotspot database (SHDB).

Tree planting on degraded land has been identified as an effective carbon capture strategy, but it is unclear how various associated restoration treatments influence carbon sequestration. In this study, we measured carbon pools in jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) stands subject to different restoration treatments within severely damaged upland areas in the metal mining region of Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Treatments included: i) soil amendment (liming, fertilizing and grass/legume seeding) followed by jack pine planting, ii) jack pine planting alone, iii) soil amendment only, and iv) untreated plots with some natural regeneration as a result of improving air quality in the region. Twenty-four years after the initial treatments, we measured the carbon storage in coarse and fine woody debris, herbs, shrubs, forest floor (LFH), mineral soil, and trees. The carbon pool in planted trees was 1.5 times higher in plots when soil amendments were applied. This increase in the tree carbon pool was the result of greater carbon sequestration per individual jack pine tree rather than changes in tree density or arrival of new species. Similarly, naturally regenerated white birch (Betula papyrifera Marshall) in the amended plots stored 1.7 times more carbon than white birch in the untreated plots. Tree planting proved essential on this landscape with natural tree regeneration rates very low even 50 years after local pollution was massively reduced. However, tree planting surprisingly did not significantly affect total carbon storage in these exposed upland sites. Total ecosystem carbon varied from 21.4 Mg ha‚àí1 to 124.5 Mg ha‚àí1 across all plots (mean of 67.6 ¬± 4.8 Mg ha‚àí1) but no statistically significant differences were observed among the treatments. Soil organic carbon (SOC) proved to be the largest carbon pool across plots and stored on average 66% of total ecosystem carbon. However, at this early stage the restoration treatments had no influence on SOC pools on this highly degraded landscape, which still appears to be severely affected by ongoing erosion of surface soil and metal contamination. The restoration treatment also did not significantly affect the understory or downed woody debris carbon pools. This study demonstrates that the current restoration treatments used in Sudbury do influence the amount of carbon sequestrated mainly through tree restoration on this industrially degraded landscape, but long-term storage potential is still limited by poor soil conditions.",,tech|04,meth|00,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118896,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

However, slow dissolution rates of minerals represent an obstacle to the widespread use of rock powders in agriculture. Rhizosphere processes and biological weathering may further enhance mineral dissolution since the interaction between minerals, plants, and bacteria results in the release of macro- and micronutrients into the soil solution. Plants are important agents in this process acting directly in the mineral dissolution or sustaining a wide diversity of weathering microorganisms in the root environment. Meanwhile, root microorganisms promote mineral dissolution by producing complexing ligands (siderophores and organic acids), affecting the pH (via organic or inorganic acid production), or performing redox reactions. Besides that, a wide variety of rhizosphere bacteria and fungi could also promote plant development directly, synergistically contributing to the weathering activity performed by plants. The inoculation of weathering bacteria in soil or plants, especially combined with the use of crushed rocks, can increase soil fertility and improve crop production. This approach is more sustainable than conventional fertilization practices, which may contribute to reducing climate change linked to agricultural activity.

This work investigated the kinetics of direct mineral carbonation of multiple-minerals natural silicate samples under conditions of 34.5 bar CO2 partial pressure, 175 ‚ÑÉ and concentration of 1.5 m NaHCO3, with corresponding carbonation efficiency more than 85% in 3 h. It was found that the carbonation of a natural mixture of minerals was kinetically controlled by chemical reaction of the olivine dissolution under moderate CO2 partial pressure and aqueous ionic strength, regardless of olivine content and associated mineral compositions. It was important for kinetics analysis to calculate the effective mineral carbonation capacity based on the magnesium and iron contents in olivine. If the carbonation capacity was calculated based on the total content of magnesium, calcium and iron as is conventional, the mineral carbonation efficiency was proportional to the olivine content in natural silicate samples.

Structural equation modelling was performed to analyze direct and indirect factors affecting organic carbon stocks and organic carbon stock changes. The pathway analyses revealed a variation of carbon stocks in the organic layer that was especially controlled by tree species. Organic layers under broadleaf trees stored less carbon than under coniferous trees, while tree species effects on carbon stocks of mineral soil were comparatively less pronounced. Soil carbon stocks were furthermore affected by site conditions. An effective selection of tree species combined with specific site conditions may therefore enhance carbon sequestration potential of soils. We found specific effects of nitrogen deposition and forest liming on carbon stock changes. The additional nitrogen has the potential to increase sequestering carbon by an increase in productivity and accumulation of soil organic matter through increased litter production, while liming may both stimulate and inhibit soil respiration depending on various environmental conditions.

Clean air policies and forest liming show an effect against soil acidification with sulfur and total acid deposition strongly decreasing over the last decades. Forest liming proved to be suitable to preserve acid-sensitive forest soils. Nitrogen eutrophication remains challenging with nitrogen deposition still being high resulting in an exceedance of critical loads for eutrophying nitrogen on many NFSI sites. Nitrogen oversupply can induce negative effects on forest biodiversity and tree nutrition and can lead to nitrate leaching into the groundwater. Due to this, the reduction of nitrogen emissions should receive high political priority. Nutrient sustainability limits biomass harvest options: many forest sites have a limited natural supply of Ca, Mg, and K, and ecosystem balances of these are often negative. Due to this, increased harvest intensity, in particular of total biomass above ground, must be carefully adjusted to the specific site conditions. Forest soils absorb heavy metals and organic pollutants (POPs) are persistent on the long term. Both heavy metals and POPs are mainly absorbed in the organic humus and soil compounds (SOC). Therefore, critical release from forest soils should be prevented by minimizing all stand and soil treatments leading to SOC decomposition. Heavy metal emissions should be strictly minimized, and pesticides with POPs should only be applied in urgent cases. Carbon sequestration in forest soil supports climate protection. Forests and forest soils provide a significant sink for CO2, complemented by the wood products from forest utilization. Sustainable forestry and highly efficient timber use in long-term products should further be supported by policies. Atmospheric pollution interacts with climate change impacts: air pollutants often predispose forests to extreme weather impacts. A significant lowering of greenhouse gas emissions is urgently needed to limit ongoing climate change (‚â§2 ¬∞C aim) to which forests in Germany are able to adapt. Forest transformation affects forest soils positively: forest transformation to broadleaved and mixed forests resulted in decreased soil acidification and increased soil organic matter. Policies should aim at increasing the mixed forest area including also coniferous species.",,tech|10,meth|05,cont|2,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.06,0.64,0.11,0.04,0.03,0.11,0.02,0.93,0.04,0.02,0.01,0.03,0.08,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.95,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.6,0.03,0.31,0.08,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-15734-0_12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Gudbrandsson,Experimental weathering rates of aluminium-silicates,G√©osciences Environnement Toulouse,"The chemical weathering of primary rocks and minerals in natural systems has a major impact on soil development and its composition. Chemical weathering is driven to a large extent by mineral dissolution. Through mineral dissolution, elements are released into groundwater and can readily react to precipitate secondary minerals such as clays, zeolites, and carbonates. Carbonates form from divalent cations (e.g. Ca, Fe and Mg) and CO2, and kaolin clay and gibbsite formation is attributed to the weathering of aluminium-rich minerals, most notably the feldspars. The CarbFix Project in Hellishei√∞i SW-Iceland aims to use natural weathering processes to form carbonate minerals by the re-injection of CO2 from a geothermal power plant back into surrounding basaltic rocks. This process is driven by the dissolution of basaltic rocks, rich in divalent cations, which can combine with injected CO2 to form and precipitate carbonates. This thesis focuses on the dissolution behaviour of Stapafell crystalline basalt, which consists of three major phases (plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine) and is rich in divalent cations. Steady-state element release rates from crystalline basalt at far-from-equilibrium conditions were measured at pH from 2 to 11 and temperatures from 5¬∞ to 75¬∞ C in mixed-flow reactors. Steady-state Si and Ca release rates exhibit a U-shaped variation with pH, where rates decrease with increasing pH at acid condition but increase with increasing pH at alkaline conditions. Silicon release rates from crystalline basalt are comparable to Si release rates from basaltic glass of the same chemical composition at low pH and temperatures ‚â•25¬∞C but slower at alkaline pH and temperatures ‚â•50¬∞C. In contrast, Mg and Fe release rates decrease continuously with increasing pH at all temperatures. This behaviour is interpreted to stem from the contrasting dissolution behaviours of the three major minerals comprising the basalt: plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine. Element release rates estimated from the sum of the volume fraction normalized dissolution rates of plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine are within one order of magnitude of those measured in this study. In addition, these experimental results show that during injection of CO2-charged waters with pH close to 3.6, crystalline basalt preferentially releases Mg and Fe relative to Ca to the fluid phase. The injection of acidic CO2-charged fluids into crystalline basaltic rocks may therefore favour the formation of Mg and Fe carbonates rather than calcite at acidic to neutral conditions. Plagioclase is the most abundant phase in crystalline basalts and thus influences strongly its reactivity. Plagioclase dissolution rates based on Si release show a common U-shaped behaviour as a function of pH where rates decrease with increasing pH at acid condition but increase with increasing pH at alkaline conditions. Constant pH plagioclase dissolution rates increase with increasing anorthite content at acid conditions, in agreement with literature findings. Interpretation and data fitting suggests that plagioclase dissolution rates are consistent with their control by the detachment of Si-rich activated complexes formed by the removal of Al from the mineral framework. Most notably, compared with previous assumptions, plagioclase dissolution rates are independent of plagioclase composition at alkaline conditions, e.g. anorthite-rich plagioclase dissolution rates increase with increasing pH at alkaline conditions. At such conditions rapid plagioclase dissolution rates likely dominate divalent metal release from crystalline basalts to the fluids phase due to its high Ca content. Gibbsite is commonly the first mineral formed during low temperature dissolution of plagioclase. Gibbsite is an aluminium-hydroxide that is found in various soils as well as the dominant phase in many bauxite ores. Gibbsite precipitation rates were measured in closed system reactors at alkaline condition, both at 25 ¬∞C and 80 ¬∞C as a function of fluid saturation state. Analyses of the solids demonstrate that gibbsite precipitation occurred in all experiments. The comparison of gibbsite precipitation to the dissolution rates of plagioclase at pH 11 shows that the rates are close to equal. The precipitation rates of gibbsite, however, decrease faster with decreasing pH than plagioclase dissolution rates. As such it seem likely that plagioclase dissolution is faster than gibbsite precipitation at near to neutral pH, and the relatively slow rate of gibbsite precipitation influences plagioclase weathering in many Earth surface systems. Kaolinite is commonly the second secondary mineral formed during low temperature dissolution of plagioclase. Kaolinite precipitation rates were measured in mixed flow reactors as a function of fluid saturation state at pH=4 and 25 ¬∞C. In total eight long-term precipitation experiments were performed in fluids mildly supersaturated with respect to kaolinite, together with a known quantity of cleaned low defect Georgia Kaolinite as seeds. Measured kaolinite precipitation rates are relatively slow compared with plagioclase dissolution rates. This observation suggests that kaolinite formation during weathering is limited by its precipitation rates rather than by the availability of aqueous species sourced from plagioclase dissolution. Taken together the results of this study provide some of the fundamental scientific basic for predicting the rates and consequences of crystalline basalt and plagioclase dissolution at both the Earth's surface and during the near surface injection of CO2 as part of carbon storage efforts. Results indicate that although gibbsite precipitation rates are relatively rapid, the relatively slow precipitation rates of kaolinite may be the process controlling the formation of this mineral at the Earth's surface. This observation highlights the need to further quantify this secondary mineral precipitation rates at conditions typical at the Earth's surface. Moreover, as the composition of divalent metals released from crystalline basalts varies significantly with pH, CO2 carbonation in basalt should yield a systematic variation in the identity of carbonate and zeolite minerals precipitated with distance from the injection site. This latter conclusion can be tested directly as part of the currently on-going CarbFix project in Hellishei√∞i, Iceland.",,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.05,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.07,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.89,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.02,0.96,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://theses.hal.science/tel-00933440,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In order to lower the environmental impact of the steel industry and ensure its economic sustainability, there have been significant studies finding the ways to recycle by-products. The formation, composition and physical properties of steel making slag are discussed with regard to the problems associated with its reuse. The volume instability caused by free lime exposure to moisture means that the reuse of steelmaking slag is often limited as many potential applications, and the leaching behavior of steelmaking slag is important for environmental considerations. Land-based applications that have been demonstrated include replacing natural sand as aggregate in cement, which may be combined with the CO2 sequestration properties. Steel slag shows use as a liming material (when spread over acidic soils to help to raise the pH to a more neutral level) and to enhance the physical properties of soft soils. Potential benefits to the marine environment is due to high porosity and large surface area, making slags ideal for coral reef repair (e.g., overcoming coral bleaching) and replacement (e.g., artificial reef to promote growth of green marine plants and seagrass), as well as a growth promoter for seaweed and phytoplankton that are microscopic organisms that are an essential component of ecosystems in oceans around the world.

The current work has developed a quantified mineralization formula through the systematic investigation of the kinetics of mineralization of a dunite containing high-grade olivine under the chemical reaction control. The effect of the most important CO2 partial pressure, addition of sodium bicarbonate, specific surface area of the olivine, addition of sodium chloride and reaction temperature can be quantified to the 1.6th, 0.8th, 0.7th, 0.34th power and 47.97 kJ/mol activation energy respectively with a relative error less than ¬±5%. When there was high addition of sodium bicarbonate, the effect of sodium chloride was not significant. Once the addition of sodium bicarbonate and the CO2 partial pressure were high enough, the mineralization was always controlled by dissolution of olivine.

Lime binders provide many advantages when compared to cement binders such as higher vapour permeability and the ability to accommodate movement. They are undergoing a resurgence in their use in the conservation of historic buildings and in combination with environmentally friendly natural materials where these attributes are particularly important. Their ability to mitigate against global warming through the sequestration of CO2 by carbonation is a further advantage which will bring impact. The equilibrium reaction products between non-hydraulic lime and olivine were calculated using the thermodynamic software GEMS3 Selektor. Experimental mortar mixes were modelled with varying ratios of quartz sand aggregate and olivine sand aggregate. The software predicted phase assemblage at equilibrium comprising calcite, dolomite, magnesite and quartz, with mass percentages depending on the ratio of quartz to olivine. The mortars morphological, chemical and mechanical properties were evaluated using Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and compressive strength testing. Significantly, this study has shown that the use of olivine based aggregates in finely divided form can enhance carbonation, and hence the CO2 absorption capacity of these mortars.

It was proposed to enhance this process to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere. While there are some studies that propose and theoretically analyze the application of rock powder on agricultural land, results from field experiments are still scarce. In order to evaluate the efficiency and side effects of Enhanced Weathering, a mesocosm experiment was set up and agricultural soil from Belgium was amended with olivine-bearing dunite ground to two different grain sizes, while distinguishing setups with and without crops. Based on measurements of Mg, Si, pH, and DIC, the additional weathering effect of olivine could be confirmed. Calculated weathering rates are up to three orders of magnitude lower than found in other studies. The calculated CO2 consumption by weathering was comparably low with 2.3 to 4.9 CO2 t km‚àí2 a‚àí1. One identified cause was preferential flow leading to a low water-rock interaction time for a significant water volume in the setup, not addressed in previous Enhanced Weathering experiments for CO2 consumption. Correction for preferential flow leads to fluxes about a magnitude higher, confirming that this process and surface runoff in the field must be included in assessments for the CO2 consumption potential of Enhanced Weathering in general. Pore water Mg / Si molar ratios suggest that dissolved Si from the added minerals stays in the system over the observation period, because a cation depleted Si layer forms on the reactive mineral surface of freshly ground rocks. This layer has not reached equilibrium thickness within the first two years. The release of potentially harmful trace elements is an acknowledged side effect of Enhanced Weathering.

In this study, we synthesized the effects of fertilizer (nitrogen and phosphorus) application, liming and grazing regime on the stock of SOC in global grasslands, under different site specific climatic settings using a meta-analysis of 341 datasets. We found an overall significant reduction (-8.5%) in the stock of SOC in global managed grasslands, mainly attributable to grazing (-15.0%), and only partially attenuated by fertilizer addition (+6.7%) and liming (+5.8%), indicating that management to improve biomass production does not contribute sufficient organic matter to replace that lost by direct removal by animals. Management activities had the greatest effect in the tropics (-22.4%) due primarily to heavy grazing, and the least effect in the temperate zone (-4.5%). The negative management effect reduced significantly with increasing mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation in the temperate zone, suggesting that temperate grassland soils are potential C sinks in the face of climate change. For a sustainable management of grasslands that will provide adequate forage for livestock and mitigate climate change through C sequestration, we recommend that future tropical grassland management policies should focus on reducing the intensity of grazing.

Firstly, stoichiometry of protonation (H+) in soils out of N-fertilization through urea, and other sources is known and the resultant annual changes in soil pH are also reported by many even using long-term experiments (Ghimire, Machado, & Bista, 2017; Stewart et al., 2015). Most of them found the changes innocuous in soils rich in clays and organic carbon that impart high-buffering capacity. Even, if the amount is significant, such drop in pH is localized at the point of its (N) application and is restricted mostly to the surface layer, excepting when applied in depth, like anhydrous NH3. As rightly indicated by the authors, most of the calcic layer in soils exists in subsurface horizon, and thus, the possibility for its coming into contact (physical availability) with the protons generated out of N-fertilization is less. Again, N with other fertilizers increases crop yield and ensures a net C-sequestration in soils (Dalal, Allen, Wang, Reeves, & Gibson, 2011; Mandal et al., 2007) that mitigates the severity of the problem. Moreover, of late, conservation agriculture is becoming popular across the continents. Such practices may increase SOC (Powlson et al., 2014) that further improves buffering capacity making soil less responsive to the above phenomenon. The reported huge amount of CO2 efflux out of decomposition of CaCO3 on N-fertilization-induced acidity, without a direct evidence of field-level measurement, may thus be unlikely. Secondly, the authors indicated a huge amount of CO2 efflux (273 √ó 1012 g CO2 C/year) from acidic soils due to liming (CaCO3) @1.0 t/ha annually over an estimated area of 3.79 √ó 109 ha. It is said that soil acidity and poverty go hand in hand. Application of such an amount of CaCO3 annually by farmers particularly of developing nations where acid soils concentrate is thus untenable. Besides, reclamation of soil acidity is done not only by CaCO3 but also by CaO, basic slag etc. wherein little CO3 exists for producing the reported flux (Bhat, Kundu, Hazra, Santra, & Mandal, 2010; Fageria & Nascente, 2014). Moreover, liming significantly increases crop productivity and biomass yield withdrawing a huge amount of CO2 from atmosphere; a part (~1/3rd) of which is stored as SOC in the hidden half offsetting again the amount of the flux (Kuzyakov & Domanski, 2000). This is corroborated by large number of studies including those of Fornara et al. (2011) who observed ~20% higher SOC stock in limed than unlimed soils under long-term experiments.

These areas have the potential to be engineered in such a way that they deliver a range of ecosystem services including flood regulation and biodiversity conservation in addition to their primary functions such as comfort of sidewalk users (mostly un-vegetated), protection of spray from passing vehicles, a space for benches, bus shelters, street lights and other public amenities, and visual improvement of the roads and designated green belts. Previous research has shown that in soils, calcium-rich materials such as recycled crushed concrete or natural crushed dolerite undergo carbonation. This effectively captures CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it in the form of CaCO3 precipitated between soil particles. Engineering this process can potentially assist the UK in achieving its ambitious target to reduce CO2 emissions by 80% of 1990 levels by 2050. Rates of carbonation measured at urban brownfield sites in the UK suggest that treating 12,000 hectares of land containing suitable amendments could remove 1 million tonne CO2 annually. However, brownfield sites are often subjected to re-construction activities which would reduce the rate of CO2 absorption from the atmosphere by sealing. To optimize the rate of carbonation, engineered soils need to be constructed at locations subjected to least post-construction activities and roadside verges and central reserves represent a key opportunity in this regard.

Mineral carbonation, also called carbon mineralization, is the conversion of (fluid) carbon dioxide into (solid) carbonate minerals in rocks, by way of naturally occurring chemical reactions. Mafic and ultramafic rocks, such as volcanic basalt, are natural candidates for carbonation, because the magnesium and iron silicate minerals in these rocks react with brines of dissolved carbon dioxide to form carbonate minerals. By trapping carbon dioxide (CO2) underground as a constituent of solid rock, carbonation of natural basalt formations would be a secure method of sequestering CO2 captured at power plants in efforts to mitigate climate change. Geochemical laboratory experiments at Yale, carried out in a batch reactor at 200¬∞C and 150 bar (15 MPa), studied carbonation of the olivine mineral forsterite (Mg2SiO4) reacting with CO2 brines in the form of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solutions. The main carbonation product in these reactions is the carbonate mineral magnesite (MgCO3). A series of 32 runs varied the reaction time, the reactive surface area of olivine grains and powders, the concentration of the reacting fluid, and the starting ratio of fluid to olivine mass. These experiments were the first to study the rate of olivine carbonation under passive conditions approaching equilibrium. The results show that, in a simple batch reaction, olivine carbonation is fastest during the first 24 hours and then slows significantly and even reverses. A natural measure of the extent of carbonation is a quantity called the carbonation fraction, which compares the amount of carbon removed from solution, during a run, to the maximum amount that could have been removed if the olivine initially present had fully dissolved and the cations released had subsequently precipitated in carbonate minerals. The carbonation fractions observed in batch experiments with olivine grains and powders varied significantly, from less than 0.01 (1%) to more than 0.5 (50%). Over time, the carbonation fractions reached an upper limit after about 24 to 72 hours of reaction, then stayed constant or decreased. The peak Final Scientific/Technical Report DE-FE0004275 | Mineral Carbonation | 4 coincided with the appearance of secondary magnesium-bearing silicate minerals, whose formation competes for magnesium ions in solution and can even promote conditions that dissolve magnesite. The highest carbonation fractions resulted from experiments with low ratios of concentrated solution to olivine, during which amorphous silica spheres or meshes formed, instead of secondary silicate minerals. The highest carbonation fractions appear to result from competing effects. Precipitation of silica layers on olivine reduces the reactive surface area and, thus, the rate of olivine dissolution (which ultimately limits the carbonation rate), but these same silica layers can also inhibit the formation of secondary silicate minerals that consume magnesite formed in earlier stages of carbonation. Simulation of these experiments with simple geochemical models using the software program EQ3/6 reproduces the general trends observed‚Äîespecially the results for the carbonation fraction in short-run experiments. Although further experimentation and better models are needed, this study nevertheless provides a framework for understanding the optimal conditions for sequestering carbon dioxide by reacting CO2-bearing fluids with rocks containing olivine minerals. A series of experiments at the Rock Physics Laboratory at the University of Maryland studied the carbonation process during deformation of thermally cracked olivine-rich rock samples (dunite) saturated with CO2 brines of varying compositions. A goal of these geomechanical experiments was to see if flow and deformation processes, which accompany natural carbonation reactions in underground settings, work to enhance or inhibit the reactions. The experiments involved hydrostatic compaction, followed by deformation at a constant rate of strain. Sample permeability was monitored during the reactions. Comparison of the samples‚Äô volume changes to their axial strains (shortening) during deformation indicates that samples reacted with CO2-saturated brines accommodate more axial compaction, before the onset of dilation (a swelling that precedes rock failure), than samples reacted with distilled water. Analyses of the reacted samples with scanning electron microscope (SEM) images indicate, first, that dissolution of olivine occurring in the initial stages of carbonation can provide pathways to fluid flow that sustain the reaction, and, second, that carbonate minerals precipitated along existing fractures in the rocks may serve as asperities, or roughness on a crack‚Äôs surface that restricts its closure. Final Scientific/Technical Report DE-FE0004275 | Mineral Carbonation | 5 In a related study undertaken by one of the principal investigators as a spin-off of the main project, a simple model of (magnesite) crystal growth in the pore space of basalts undergoing carbonation was developed. The model suggests that, under a carefully controlled program of CO2 injection, carbonate mineral growth can harden the rock formation against earthquakes that might otherwise be induced by the injection of large fluid volumes (Yarushina and Bercovici, 2013). The overall conclusion of the research project is that mineral carbonation of underground mafic and ultramafic rock formations is a viable candidate for long-term sequestration of man-made carbon dioxide. No results obtained during the project indicate that the method is inherently intractable in its implementation; moreover, enormous volumes of basalt near Earth‚Äôs surface are candidate locations for large-scale injection programs. The geochemical experiments do indicate, however, that there will be significant engineering challenges in maintaining high rates of carbonation, by delaying the onset of chemical conditions that promote formation of secondary silicate minerals and, therefore, slow down, or even reverse, the carbonation process. It remains an open question as to whether carbonation processes can be sustained for many years in an engineered system operating on a large scale‚Äîa scale capable of accommodating millions of tons of CO2 annually. The development of realistic theoretical models that can systematically describe the combined effects of reactive flow, precipitation and geomechanical deformation is a major barrier to further understanding of the practical viability of mineral carbonation as large-scale method of carbon sequestration.",,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.41,0.0,0.02,0.17,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.57,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.0,0.95,0.39,0.02,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.2172/1214541,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Box 5694, Flagstaff, AZ 86011, USA","Liming and fertilization of grasslands have been used for centuries to sustain hay production. Besides improving hay yields, these practices induce compositional shifts in plant and soil microbial communities, including symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, in spite of increasing interest in soil carbon (C) sequestration to offset anthropogenic CO2 emissions, little is known about the long-term effects of these agronomic interventions on soil C stocks. We examined how plants, AM fungi, and soil C respond to more than seven decades of annual applications of lime, mineral nitrogen (N), and mineral phosphorus (P) to test the hypotheses that (1) management practices increasing aboveground plant production decrease C allocation to roots, AM fungi and the soil; and (2) the relative availability of N and P predicts belowground C allocation in a consistent manner. Our study was conducted at the Rengen Grassland Experiment, established in 1941. Lime combined with N increased hay yields and promoted development of AM fungal hyphae in soil, while reducing relative C allocation to roots. Simultaneous enrichment of soil with lime, N, and P further boosted hay production, promoted grasses and suppressed other plant functional groups. This treatment also decreased soil organic C and strongly suppressed AM fungi in the soil, although the response to P varied among different AM fungal taxa. Our results indicate that agricultural management practices aimed at maximization of hay production may, in the long run, significantly (‚àí20%) reduce belowground C storage. This is a great concern with respect to the intended use of grasslands as anthropogenic CO2 sinks because the fertilization-induced decrease in soil C stocks can partly or fully negate the C sequestration potential of the grassland ecosystems as a whole.",,tech|04,meth|00,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.93,0.04,0.02,0.02,0.03,0.06,0.74,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.94,0.03,0.02,0.04,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.12.026,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Unfortunately addition of desired minerals through fertilizers also accompanies the undesired heavy metal content (stable and/or radioactive). Continuous application of fertilizers may result in buildup of heavy metals, thus, posing a threat to the environment and plants, and consequently to human life.The present study was conducted to investigate the extent of the threat caused not only by phosphate fertilizers (PFs) but also by phosphate rock (PR) and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC).Representative samples of PR from Hazara deposits, Pakistan, various types of PF used in Pakistan and the fertilizer waste, PCC, from a local fertilizer industry, were taken and analyzed for their radioactive and heavy metal content. Radioactivity was measured by gamma spectrometry using high purity germanium (HPGe) detector while heavy metals were determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) technique. Some of the elements were also determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Major chemical composition for rock samples was quantified by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry technique. Variable amounts of elements like Ba, Sn, Th, V and rare earth elements (REEs) were present in all the studied sites of phosphate rocks.The elements Al, Cr, Cs, Fe, Sb and Zn were present in relatively higher amounts in Kakul phosphate rock crushing plant (KPRCP). Analysis of toxic elements depicts that Pb is present at relatively higher level in local phosphate rock samples while Cd and Zn are present in comparable amount.Assessment of hazards posed by heavy metals in PR showed that consumers are exposed to heavy metals from various pathways.The results indicated that Pakistani PR is agronomically effective. However, it contains higher values for toxic element like Ni, Pb and Cu that may be transferred to fertilizers and then to soil and plants grown on them thus threatening human life.The specific activity analysis showed that outdoor and indoor external dose from PR is higher than the maximum value of world‚Äüs soil background level.It was noted that all of the studied phosphate fertilizers are rich in their mineralogical (Fe, K, Mn and Na) content while NPK fertilizers contain relatively higher amount of K.The activity concentrations of 40K and 232Th in the single superphosphate (SSP) fertilizer are lower than that of phosphorite of Pakistan. Monitoring of radon indicated greater risk for miners than the personnel working in fertilizer warehouses.Variations in heavy metal content for PCC may be due to the fact that the collected waste samples were produced from various batches of fertilizer production.The average value for outdoor and indoor external dose from PCC waste is about three times and twice the background median value of absorbed dose of gamma rays from worldwide soil respectively.This indicates the level of radiological hazard from PCC waste to surrounding environment. Corresponding effective dose was 1.2ÔÇ±0.1 mSv yÔÄ≠1, which is higher than the annual limit of 1 mSv recommended by ICRP.The analysis of soil and crop samples (edible parts of rice, wheat and mungbean) was also performed and transfer factor (TF) from soil to crop was calculated. Greater TFs for Al, Eu, Fe, K, Sc, Sr and Zn were observed for mungbean than the other studied crops.Furthermore PLI (pollution load index) values are greater than one for all the fertilizer applied soil samples except rice growing soil samples which is just below one, showing pollution load in the respective soil environment after the applications of PFs. Moreover, the calculated health risk index (HRI) depicted a greater risk to human health from Al, Pb and Sb as they have HRI greater than one.It is concluded that special attention by environmental authorities should be given to phosphate industry of Pakistan to minimize these hazards and safety measures should be taken to decrease the risk being posed from it",,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.04,0.0,0.01,0.03,0.32,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.04,0.59,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.02,0.98,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,http://prr.hec.gov.pk/jspui/handle/123456789/1767,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The originality of this paper stems from the novel two-stage approach. In the first stage, natural carbonation of olivine and carbonation of olivine treated soil under different CO2 pressures and times were investigated. In this stage, the unconfined compression test was used as a tool to evaluate the strength performance. In the second stage, details of the installation and performance of carbonated olivine columns using a laboratory-scale model were investigated. In this respect, olivine was mixed with the natural soil using the auger and the columns were then carbonated with gaseous CO2. The unconfined compressive strengths of soil in the first stage increased by up to 120% compared to those of the natural untreated soil. The strength development was found to be proportional to the CO2 pressure and carbonation period. Microstructural analyses indicated the presence of magnesite on the surface of carbonated olivine-treated soil, demonstrating that modified physical properties provided a stronger and stiffer matrix. The performance of the carbonated olivine-soil columns, in terms of ultimate bearing capacity, showed that the carbonation procedure occurred rapidly and yielded a bearing capacity value of 120 kPa. Results of this study are of significance to the construction industry as the feasibility of carbonated olivine for strengthening and stabilizing soil is validated. Its applicability lies in a range of different geotechnical applications whilst also mitigates the global warming through the sequestration of CO2.",,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrmge.2015.11.001,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Clary,The Resource beneath Our Feet: Gaining a New Awareness during the International Year of Soils,,"We purchase small bags of soil for our household plants and till our yards to develop gardens. We plow, cultivate, trample, contaminate, and remove soil. Our food, clothing, and ecosystems closely intertwine with soil, and yet we seldom notice or appreciate it. Though soils continue to develop and mature, we degrade and destroy soil at an increasing rate (Amundson et al. 2015). By one estimate, erosion, nutrient depletion, acidification, salinization, compaction, and chemical pollution have moderately to highly degraded 33% of soil worldwide (FAO 2015b). To increase public awareness of the importance of soil, the United Nations General Assembly designated 2015 as the International Year of Soils (IYS). One objective is to educate people about the crucial role of soils in food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation, essential ecosystem services, poverty alleviation, and sustainable development (FAO 2015a). This article describes activities in which students sample, investigate, classify, and compare characteristics (i.e., texture, color, density, porosity) of local soils, evaluating whether the soils are healthy or at risk. Students investigate correlations between geology and geography, predict which soil types may go extinct in their state, and analyze how this will affect people. [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] [FIGURE 2 OMITTED] A soil primer Soil, an accumulation of weathering products on the Earth's surface, is part of the pedosphere, which interacts with the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. It can include varying amounts of organic material (e.g., humus) and pieces of broken rock. During weathering and erosion, exposed rock can break down to smaller particles. Physical weathering processes include frost wedging, pressure release (to create exfoliation domes), and the mechanical breakdown of rocks through biological activity (e.g., growing tree roots, burrowing animals). Rocks can also weather chemically, resulting in smaller particles of a different composition. Chemical weathering processes include dissolution, oxidation, and hydrolysis. Soils are not homogeneous, and a layered soil profile develops over time (Figure 1). A typical soil profile has four main zones or horizons: * O: build-up of organics, humus; * A: zone of leaching, intense biological activity, topsoil; * B: zone of accumulation, ores, subsoil; and * C: partially disintegrated bedrock. [FIGURE 3 OMITTED] Soil horizons (layers) can evolve and vary in thickness. Figure 2 illustrates how soil quality in Montana changed through agriculture, urbanization, and restoration. Rock type and size (i.e., sand, silt, clay), climate, and topography affect soil formation--leading to many variations of soil horizons. These many types of soils constitute an area's pedodiversity (i.e., the variations of soil properties and classes). The United States categorizes over 13,000 soil series (Tennesen 2014), which the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Soil Taxonomy classifies according to 12 soil orders (Figure 3). Information, pictures, and global distributions of the orders are available online (see On the web). Soils in the classroom In the activities described below, students investigate local soils that are relevant to them (Clary and Wandersee 2006) to identify characteristics and classify the soils via texture, color, density, and porosity. Collecting soils The following tips for classroom soil sampling come from Bigham (2010) and Taylor and Graves (2010). Before collection, teachers should determine how much soil is needed from each collection site, based on the classroom soil activities that will follow. Use agricultural areas and undisturbed natural areas for sample sites. Soil types can vary within a relatively short distance (e.g., the soil atop a natural levee differs from the soil on the slope), so collect several soil samples at a site to document soil diversity. ‚Ä¶",,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.52,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.04,0.8,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.03,0.05,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.52,0.02,0.03,0.27,0.06,0.01,0.01,0.05,0.03,0.08,0.71,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-427556748/the-resource-beneath-our-feet-gaining-a-new-awareness,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Although liming contributes to increased rates of respiration from soil thereby potentially reducing soils ability to act as a CO2 sink, the long-term effects of liming on soil organic carbon (Corg) sequestration are largely unknown. Here, using data spanning 129 years of the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted (UK), we show net Corg sequestration measured in the 0‚Äì23 cm layer at different time intervals since 1876 was 2‚Äì20 times greater in limed than in unlimed soils. The main cause of this large Corg accrual was greater biological activity in limed soils, which despite increasing soil respiration rates, led to plant C inputs being processed and incorporated into resistant soil organo-mineral pools. Limed organo-mineral soils showed: (1) greater Corg content for similar plant productivity levels (i.e. hay yields); (2) higher 14C incorporation after 1950s atomic bomb testing and (3) lower C : N ratios than unlimed organo-mineral soils, which also indicate higher microbial processing of plant C. Our results show that greater Corg sequestration in limed soils strongly reduced the global warming potential of long-term liming to permanent grassland suggesting the net contribution of agricultural liming to global warming could be lower than previously estimated. Our study demonstrates that liming might prove to be an effective mitigation strategy, especially because liming applications can be associated with a reduced use of nitrogen fertilizer which is a key cause for increased greenhouse gas emissions from agro-ecosystems.",,tech|04,meth|03,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02328.x,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Apart from the ever increasing cost of chemical fertilizers their use over the last seventy or more years have had a deleterious effect on soil health. In contrast the bio-fertilizer, composed of organic waste and crushed zeolitic rock, containing Clinoptilolite and commonly Mordenite zeolite, functions biologically in sponsoring nitrification. Ammonium ions, provided from the degradation of the organic waste, are adsorbed to the zeolite mineral surface thus avoiding loss to the atmosphere by volatilization. Oxidation of the ammonium ions, by soil nitrifying micro-organisms, provides major and trace element nutrients. Analysis of pore water, from substrates amended with the bio-fertilizer, has shown that its electrical conductivity is orders of magnitude higher than that of pore water from un-treated substrates. This is reflected in the high ionic concentration of cations present, which covers a wide range of elements, providing essential major and beneficial trace-elements in the ionic state that are directly available for plant uptake. Further work has shown that without the organic component the degree of plant growth is greatly reduced and the converse applies in that the application of the organic waste without the crushed zeolitic rock again reduces plant growth. Many countries in the world have extensive deposits of zeolitic sediment, containing a high abundance of zeolite minerals, and the organic component, being animal or plant waste, is generally availability.",,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.58,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.08,0.64,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.98,0.01,0.03,0.0,0.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.4172/2168-9881.1000130,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Using magnetic, density, and size separation, we isolated a plagioclase (An20)-K-feldspar fraction from an arid zone soil (classified as Pachappa, Mollic Haploxeralf). Silica release rates decreased with time and after up to 3.7 years were in the range 0.02 √ó 10‚àí12 mol m‚àí2 s‚àí1, when surface area is expressed with BET surface area or 0.6 √ó 10‚àí12 mol m‚àí2 s‚àí1, when expressed with geometric surface area. These Si rates are in good agreement with published field rates, as are the individual mineral dissolution rates calculated from mineral abundance and cation release. These data are in contrast to faster laboratory determined rates based on crushed or ground samples, or shorter reaction times. Based on laboratory studies with and without various pretreatments, we conclude that organic and Fe oxide surface coatings due to natural weathering are not the explanation for our low reaction rates.

We disprove the paradigm that olivine weathering in nature would be a slow process, and show that it is not needed to mill olivine to very fine, 10 Œºm-size grains in order to arrive at a complete dissolution within 1‚Äì2 year. In high-energy shallow marine environments olivine grains and reaction products on the grain surfaces, that otherwise would greatly retard the reaction, are abraded so that the chemical reaction is much accelerated. When kept in motion even large olivine grains rubbing and bumping against each other quickly produce fine clay- and silt-sized olivine particles that show a fast chemical reaction. Spreading of olivine in the world's 2% most energetic shelf seas can compensate a year's global CO2 emissions and counteract ocean acidification against a price well below that of carbon credits.",,tech|11,meth|05,cont|5,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.64,0.94,0.02,0.02,0.09,0.04,0.01,0.0,0.03,0.05,0.05,0.01,0.76,0.01,0.0,0.02,0.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.99,,https://doi.org/10.5194/esdd-2-551-2011,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Major element concentrations were combined with Pb and Sr isotopic analyses of starting materials and output solutions and together enabled us to elucidate several important mechanisms related to granitoid rock weathering. We observed an initial stage of rock dissolution (<200 hours of reaction) that was characterized by elemental release from traces of calcite and/or apatite and to a lesser extent from the interlayer sites of biotite. Dissolution in the interval of 200 to 400 h was dominated by the release of elements from the interlayer sites of biotite, and at 400 to 1000 h of reaction the chemistry of output solutions was dominated by the release of elements from tetrahedral and octahedral sites of biotite as well as from plagioclase. After 1000 h, the dissolution of plagioclase, and to a lesser extent biotite, dominated the composition of elements released by the rock. We demonstrate that Pb and Sr isotope ratios in the output solutions can be used to identify each of these stages of dissolution. By comparing our experimental results on the release of Pb and Sr isotopes with field measurements of Pb and Sr isotopes in soil chronosequences from the Wind River and the Sierra Nevada Mountains (USA), we are able to show that similar isotopic patterns appear in both the pH 1 experiments and in soils formed under natural conditions at higher pH. By combining these experimental results with previous field studies, we are able to estimate the duration of most of these stages of granitoid weathering under natural conditions in temperate climates. In soils older than a few hundred years and younger than 10,000 yr the release of elements from interlayer sites of biotite controls the weathering flux. Soils between 10,000 and 100,000 yr old are dominated by biotite and plagioclase weathering, with biotite weathering controlling the first part of this period and plagioclase dominating the later part. After more than 100,000 yr, plagioclase, and to a lesser degree biotite, dominate the weathering flux within these granitoid soils.",,tech|10,,,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.11,0.01,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.86,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2004.04.022,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

CO2 sequestration by mineral carbonation can be achieved by the reaction of CO2 with alkaline silicates. Here, we evaluate how alkaline silicate mineral-based CO2 sequestration can be achieved using environmental biotechnological processes. Several biotechnological processes rely on the sequence of (i) an acid-producing reaction such as nitrification and anaerobic fermentation and (ii) an alkalinity-producing reaction such as denitrification and methanogenesis. Whereas the acid-producing reaction can be used to enhance the dissolution of, for example, alkaline calcium silicates, the subsequent alkalinity-producing step can precipitate CaCO3.

We have used quantitative mineralogical data and Œ¥13C, Œ¥18O and F14C isotopic data to quantify the amount of CO2 fixation and identify carbon sources. Our radiocarbon results indicate that at least 80% of carbon stored in hydromagnesite has been captured from the modern atmosphere. Stable isotopic results indicate that dissolution of atmospheric CO2 into mine tailings water is kinetically limited, which suggests that the current rate of carbon mineralization could be accelerated. Reactive transport modeling is used to describe the observed variation in tailings mineralogy and to estimate rates of CO2 fixation. Based on our assessment, approximately 39,800 t/yr of atmospheric CO2 are being trapped and stored in tailings at Mount Keith. This represents an offsetting of approximately 11% of the mine's annual greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, passive sequestration via enhanced weathering of mineral waste can capture and store a significant amount of CO2.

The hydromagnesite [Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2¬∑4H2O] playas of Atlin, British Columbia, Canada provide a natural model to examine mineral carbonation on a watershed scale. At near surface conditions, CO2 is biogeochemically sequestered by microorganisms that are involved in weathering of bedrock and precipitation of carbonate minerals. The purpose of this study was to characterize the weathering regime in a groundwater recharge zone and the depositional environments in the playas in the context of a biogeochemical model for CO2 sequestration with emphasis on microbial processes that accelerate mineral carbonation. Regions with ultramafic bedrock, such as Atlin, represent the best potential sources of feedstocks for mineral carbonation. Elemental compositions of a soil profile show significant depletion of MgO and enrichment of SiO2 in comparison to underlying ultramafic parent material. Polished serpentinite cubes were placed in the organic horizon of a coniferous forest soil in a groundwater recharge zone for three years. Upon retrieval, the cube surfaces, as seen using scanning electron microscopy, had been colonized by bacteria that were associated with surface pitting. Degradation of organic matter in the soil produced chelating agents and acids that contributed to the chemical weathering of the serpentinite and would be expected to have a similar effect on the magnesium-rich bedrock at Atlin. Stable carbon isotopes of groundwater from a well, situated near a wetland in the southeastern playa, indicate that ‚àº 12% of the dissolved inorganic carbon has a modern origin from soil CO2. The mineralogy and isotope geochemistry of the hydromagnesite playas suggest that there are three distinct depositional environments: (1) the wetland, characterized by biologically-aided precipitation of carbonate minerals from waters concentrated by evaporation, (2) isolated wetland sections that lead to the formation of consolidated aragonite sediments, and (3) the emerged grassland environment where evaporation produces mounds of hydromagnesite. Examination of sediments within the southeastern playa‚Äìwetland suggests that cyanobacteria, sulphate reducing bacteria, and diatoms aid in producing favourable geochemical conditions for precipitation of carbonate minerals. The Atlin site, as a biogeochemical model, has implications for creating carbon sinks that utilize passive microbial, geochemical and physical processes that aid in mineral carbonation of magnesium silicates. These processes could be exploited for the purposes of CO2 sequestration by creating conditions similar to those of the Atlin site in environments, artificial or natural, where the precipitation of magnesium carbonates would be suitable. Given the vast quantities of Mg-rich bedrock that exist throughout the world, this study has significant implications for reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and combating global climate change.",,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2009.01.012,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The addition of aglime has the potential to increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to the release of CO2 during the chemical dissolution of aglime and due to pH-induced changes to soil biological processes. Currently, Australia‚Äôs GHG accounting system assumes that all the carbon contained in aglime is released to the atmosphere during dissolution in accordance with the Tier 1 methodology of the IPCC. However, a recent approach by TO West and AC McBride has questioned this assumption, hypothesising that a proportion of the carbon from riverine-transported aglime may be sequestered in seawater. In addition, there is presently no capacity within Australia‚Äôs carbon accounting system to quantify changes to GHG emissions from lime-induced changes to soil biological processes. Therefore, the primary objective of this review was to examine the chemical and biological processes occurring during the application of aglime and the subsequent fluxes in CO2, N2O, and CH4 from soil, with particular reference to the Australian environment. Estimates for CO2 emissions from aglime application in Australia using the contrasting methodologies of the IPCC and West and McBride were compared. Using the methodology of the IPCC it was determined that from the aglime applied in Australia in 2002, 0.995 Tg of CO2 would have been emitted, whereas this figure was reduced to 0.659‚Äì0.860 Tg of CO2 using the methodology of West and McBride. However, the accuracy of these estimates is currently limited by poor understanding of the manner in which aglime moves within the Australian landscapes. In addition, there are only a very small number of Australian studies that have examined the effect of aglime on GHG emissions due to changes in soil biological processes, limiting the ability of Australian modellers to accurately incorporate these processes within the carbon accounting system.",,tech|10,meth|05,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.59,0.03,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.12,0.92,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.01,0.96,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.98,,https://doi.org/10.1071/sr09057,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The idea of phytomining nickel was suggested earlier, but never implemented. This situation may soon change, because the mining sector suffers from a poor image on account of the impact of mining on the environment, and would like to reduce the pollution and high energy consumption associated with metal extraction. Once phytomining is established as a viable way of nickel production, it is likely that governments will impose nickel mines to realize part of their nickel production by this method. This will lead to a considerable decrease of CO2 emissions. Phytomining from rocks rich in olivine or serpentine is CO2-negative. When metal extraction goes hand in hand with CO2 sequestration, it will improve the image of the mining sector. Other advantages include that unproductive soils can serve to grow nickel hyperaccumulator plants and recover nickel. The extensive mining technology can provide employment to many poor farmers/miners.

These suggestions are commendable, but their suggested time scheme lacks realism. The emerging economies (China, India, and Brazil) want to develop their economies and raise the standard of living. A prerequisite is access to abundant and cheap energy. They want to realize their objectives by using their large coal reserves.

The climate problem can be solved by removing CO2 from the atmosphere. House et al. (2) state that capturing CO2 from the air costs around $1,000 per tonne. They have obviously not looked at enhanced weathering of olivine. We have shown that enhanced weathering of olivine leads to mineral carbonation at $10 per tonne of CO2 [Schuiling and Krijgsman (3)]. This estimate is based on data for the cost of mining and milling of bulk rocks (4). The crushed rock is then left to nature, without costly add-on technologies to speed up its weathering. Our olivine option is one of the remaining 11 contenders of originally more than 2,600 proposals for the Virgin Earth Challenge to remove 1 billion tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere. If costs were really around $1,000 per tonne of CO2, as claimed by House et al. (2), the proposal would have been kicked out in the first round.

All emerging economies possess many large dunite massifs (rocks consisting of >90% of olivine). Emissions can be compensated for by mining and milling them, and spreading the crushed olivine. Emission reduction or emission compensation is equally beneficial against climate change. Wilson et al. (5) show that crushed magnesium silicates weather rapidly, even in adverse climates, and capture large volumes of CO2 without human intervention.

Humanity will be forced to change to reduce its carbon footprint, but the rate of change will probably be dictated by the rate at which fossil fuel deposits become exhausted. The Western industrialized nations should work mainly on emission reduction and renewable energy. The emerging economies should compensate for their emissions by enhanced weathering using their own mineral resources, and thus contribute to solve the problems of climate change and ocean acidification at a very moderate cost and in harmony with the environment.

This residue was carbonated exposing it to the air in artificial pools with controlled solid-to-liquid and surface-to-volume ratios, and the efficiency of this simple mineral carbonation process was maximized. Considering realistic values of just one acetylene production plant, the intelligent handling of the calcium-rich waste would make it possible to counteract the emission of around 800 t of carbon dioxide per year, so the CO2 emissions of the acetylene production could be completely compensated and its carbon footprint significantly reduced. X-ray diffraction patterns and thermogravimetric analyses reported the conversion, up to 88%, of the calcium hydroxide into calcium carbonate under atmospheric conditions. So, considering a realistic industrial scale-up, 476 kg of CO2 could be captured with 1 t of dry waste. The morphology of the grains is resolved by electron microscopy, and can be described as needles 15 nm wide and 200 nm long arranged in grains smaller than 1 micron.

This study investigates experimentally the aqueous carbonation mechanisms of an alkaline paper mill waste containing about 55 wt% portlandite (Ca(OH)2) as a possible mineralogical CO2 sequestration process. The overall carbonation reaction includes the following steps: (1) Ca release from portlandite dissolution, (2) CO2 dissolution in water and (3) CaCO3 precipitation. This CO2 sequestration mechanism was supported by geochemical modelling of final solutions using PHREEQC software, and observations by scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction of final reaction products. According to the experimental protocol, the system proposed would favour the total capture of approx. 218 kg of CO2 into stable calcite/ton of paper waste, independently of initial CO2 pressure. The final product from the carbonation process is a calcite (ca. 100 wt%)-water dispersion.

Ultramafic rock has the potential to act as a magnesium source for carbonate precipitation reactions utilizing atmospheric CO2. This study characterizes the release of magnesium from chrysotile tailings from the Clinton Creek Asbestos Mine (Yukon, Canada) by means of a 42-day leaching experiment using sulfuric acid. Low acid concentrations (targeting 8.33% and 16.67% dissolution of chrysotile) resulted in stoichiometric, dissolution. Moderate (33.33% and 66.67% dissolution) and high (100% dissolution) acid concentrations resulted in non-stoichiometric dissolution of chrysotile. Here, the concentration ratio of Mg:Si in solution was greater than expected for moderate acid concentrations and lower than expected for high acid concentrations. The moderate acid reaction system demonstrated that as much as 84% of the magnesium found in chrysotile can be released into solution via chemical weathering. However, at high acid concentrations, Mg values were in fact lower than the moderate acid reactivity, presumably resulting from adsorption of soluble magnesium to amorphous silica, a byproduct of extensive magnesium leaching from chrysotile fibers. The production of magnesium-rich solutions in this experiment demonstrates that a highly concentrated starting material for magnesium carbonate precipitation reactions can be produced from chrysotile-bearing tailings, providing ultra-mafic hosted mines with an important resource for developing technological strategies for reducing their net carbon emissions.

Here we examine the impact of liming on global warming potential by comparing the sum of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ to carbonate alkalinity in soil solutions beneath unmanaged vegetation versus limed row crops, and of streams and rivers in agricultural versus forested watersheds, mainly in southern Michigan. Soil solutions sampled by tension indicated that lime can act as either a source or a sink for CO 2 . However, infiltrating waters tended to indicate net CO 2 uptake, as did tile drainage waters and streams draining agricultural watersheds. As nitrate concentrations increased in infiltrating waters, lime switched from a net CO 2 sink to a source, implying nitrification as a major acidifying process.

Since the kinetics of this reaction is very slow at ambient conditions, to exploit some of the above mentioned effects of chemical weathering for developing specific engineered processes, such as waste chemical stabilization and CO2 mineral storage, carbonation processes carried out under selected and controlled operational conditions have been developed, in order to significantly increase the kinetics of the reactions involved. Depending on the application of the process and the selected material, different operating conditions have been employed and several process routes have been tested.
The main objective of this doctoral thesis was to investigate the accelerated carbonation process applied both to minerals and industrial residues in order to gain new insight on the key reaction mechanisms for each type of material. 
Regarding accelerated carbonation of minerals, the effects of the presence of high pressure CO2 (up to 100 bar) and salinity on olivine dissolution kinetics at 120 ¬∞C in a stirred flow-through reactor were specifically investigated, in order to assess whether these parameters may exert an enhancing or inhibiting effect on the kinetics of Mg dissolution. 
Batch carbonation experiments on humidified material (with liquid to solid ratios < 1 l/kg) at mild operating conditions (temperature of 30-50 ¬∞C and CO2 pressure of 1-10 bar) were specifically carried out on waste incineration residues such as bottom ash (BA) and air pollution control (APC) residues, as well as on stainless steel slag. The objectives of this study were essentially threefold: to assess the CO2 storage capacity achievable for each type of industrial residue correlating it to the particle size and to the chemical composition of the samples; to study the influence of the main operational parameters (temperature, pressure and liquid to solid ratio) on reaction kinetics; and finally to investigate the effects of carbonation on the mineralogy and leaching behaviour of the residues.
The study on olivine dissolution kinetics showed that, under all the examined operating conditions (pH range 3-8), the only factor governing the specific dissolution rate was the pH of the solution. Hence CO2 pressure and salinity appeared to influence olivine dissolution kinetics only indirectly, by affecting the final pH of the solution. This is a significant finding, since it implies that carbonate precipitation, which occurs in presence of high pressure CO2 at pH values above 6, and olivine dissolution could theoretically be carried out in the same reactor without inhibition effects on Mg dissolution kinetics.
As for the effects of accelerated carbonation on the leaching behaviour of the studied alkaline residues, significant results were obtained in particular for the BA and APC residues; for both types of materials, accelerated carbonation showed to exert a strong immobilization effect on Pb, Zn and Cu, which were among the critical elements in terms of heavy metal leaching for both types of untreated residues. For APC ash, chemical speciation modelling indicated a change in the solubility-controlling minerals from the untreated to the carbonated ash. For the latter, metal release was found to be clearly controlled by a number of carbonate minerals, indicating the potential of the carbonation process to convert the initial metal-containing minerals into generally less soluble carbonate forms, with positive implications on the environmental behaviour of the ash.
Significant CO2 uptakes were achieved in particular for the APC ash (250 g/kg residue); however, owing due to the meagre quantities of this material generated in incineration plants compared to CO2 emissions, accelerated carbonation of this type of industrial residues, as well as of bottom ash, does not appear to be a feasible process for CO2 storage. Accelerated carbonation of stainless steel slag instead, appears to be an interesting technique for carrying out mineral storage of carbon dioxide in industrial facilities using part of the waste streams generated in the same plant, although more severe operating conditions than those used in this work should be applied in order to increase the CO2 uptake of the slag.",,tech|10,meth|01,cont|5,0.12,0.01,0.02,0.09,0.04,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.88,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.94,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://art.torvergata.it/handle/2108/1003,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

One of the theoretically feasible and promising methods of reducing CO2 in the atmosphere is to sequester it by forming thermodynamically stable carbonates. Olivine, (Mg, Fe)2SiO4, is an abundant mineral that can react with CO2 to form carbonates when deliberately introduced into seawater. However, in addition to increasing the additional uptake of atmospheric CO2, it is inevitably accompanied by the release of other elements (e.g. Si, Ca, Mg, Fe and Ni) which could have adverse effects on marine organisms when those elements are at high levels. In this article, the reaction kinetics and mechanisms of olivine dissolution in seawater were introduced, the influencing factors on the olivine dissolution rate under ex situ conditions were highlighted, the possible impacts of the released products on marine organisms (mainly primary producers) and biogeochemical processes controlled by marine organisms were analyzed, and the potential applications to increase marine carbon storage were discussed.

One such method is to increase the amount of organic matter in the soil, and domestic organic residues (DOR) are commonly used for this purpose. The environmental impact of DOR-derived products, from production to agricultural application, remains unclear in current research. With the aim to have a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities in DOR management and reuse, this study extended the boundaries of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to include the transport, treatment, and application of treated DOR on a national level while also quantifying soil carbon sequestration that has been less addressed in relevant LCA studies. This study focuses on The Netherlands, where incineration predominates, as a representative case to explore the benefits and trade-offs of moving towards more biotreatment for DOR. Two main biotreatments were considered, composting and anaerobic digestion. The results indicate that biotreatment of kitchen and yard residues generally has higher environmental impacts than incineration, including increased global warming and fine particulate matter formation. However, biotreatment of sewage sludge has lower environmental impacts than incineration. Substitution of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers with compost reduces mineral and fossil resource scarcity. In fossil-based energy systems like The Netherlands, replacing incineration with anaerobic digestion yields the highest benefit for fossil resource scarcity (61.93 %) due to energy recovery from biogas and the predominant use of fossil resources in the Dutch energy system. These findings indicate that replacing incineration with biotreatment of DOR may not benefit all impact categories in LCA. The environmental performance of substituted products can significantly influence the environmental benefits of increased biotreatment. Future studies or implementation of increased biotreatment should consider trade-offs and local context.",,tech|04,meth|04,cont|5,0.03,0.02,0.01,0.08,0.64,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.22,0.56,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.1,0.08,0.04,0.14,0.82,0.16,0.04,0.03,0.02,0.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06,0.96,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

This land use class occupies ~50 Mha of the biome, of which approximately 2/3 show signs of degradation. Pasture recovery has become an environmental public policy in Brazil, as it improves land use efficiency and contributes to soil carbon sequestration. However, as intensification leads to higher cattle stocking rates and external inputs (fertilizers, liming, etc.), the impact of improved pastures on greenhouse gas mitigation is still debatable. This study focused on the Cerrado biome and aimed to (i) quantify soil carbon stock changes under different scenarios of management and recovery of degraded pastures. In addition, (ii) the potential for capturing carbon in the soil to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by the intensification of pastures was evaluated. Before the intensification scenario, the total carbon stock was estimated to be ~1,830 Mt for the pasture area, whose spatial distribution corresponded to edaphoclimatic contrasts and pasture conditions. The highest soil organic carbon stocks were observed in the non-degraded pastures. With the increase in carrying capacity, a potential increase of 1/3 in livestock beef cattle production was estimated, owing to the recovery of degraded areas through intensive management. This increment is sufficient to meet the increase in livestock production, projected at ~12% by the end of the decade, if all pasture areas are recovered. In contrast, the increase in soil C stocks was sufficient to compensate for only 27% and 42% of the GHG emissions in areas with intermediate and severe degradation, respectively. Therefore, for a compromise between economy and environment, other strategies are required to reduce GHG emissions and/or enhance C sinks, such as an increase in tree density on the farm. From this perspective, livestock intensification should be based on the landscape scale for the promotion of C stocks and diversity of ecosystem services.",,tech|04,meth|02,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.9,0.04,0.03,0.02,0.03,0.04,0.78,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.1,0.01,0.91,0.18,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06,0.95,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4494240,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Liming is an effective method of restoring acidified soil. To understand the effects of liming on soil respiration and temperature sensitivity within the context of acid deposition, we measured soil respiration and its components in Chinese fir plantations for one year beginning in June 2020, with 0, 1 and 5 t¬∑hm-2 calcium oxide being added in 2018. The results showed that liming considerably increased soil pH and exchangeable Ca2+ concentration, and that there was no significant difference among different levels of lime application. Soil respiration rate and components in the Chinese fir plantations exhibited seasonal variations, with the highest values during the summer and the lowest values during the winter. Although liming did not alter seasonal dynamics, it strongly inhibited heterotrophic respiration rate and increased autotrophic respiration rate of soil, with minor effect on total soil respiration. The monthly dynamics of soil respiration and temperature were largely consistent. There was a clear exponential relationship between soil respiration and soil temperature. Liming increased temperature sensitivity Q10 of soil respiration and autotrophic respiration but reduced that of soil heterotrophic respiration. In conclusion, liming promoted soil autotrophic respiration and strongly inhibited soil heterotrophic respiration in Chinese fir plantations, which would facilitate soil carbon sequestration.ÊàëÂõΩÈÖ∏Ê≤âÈôç‰∏ªË¶ÅÂàÜÂ∏ÉÂå∫Âüü‰∏éÊùâÊú®‰∫∫Â∑•Êûó‰∏ªË¶ÅÂàÜÂ∏ÉÂå∫ÂüüÈáçÂêà,Áü≥ÁÅ∞Ê∑ªÂä†ÊòØÊîπËâØÈÖ∏ÂåñÂúüÂ£§ÁöÑÊúâÊïàÊé™ÊñΩ„ÄÇ‰∏∫Êé¢Á©∂ÈÖ∏Ê≤âÈôçËÉåÊôØ‰∏ãÊñΩÁü≥ÁÅ∞ÂØπÂúüÂ£§ÂëºÂê∏ÂèäÂÖ∂Ê∏©Â∫¶ÊïèÊÑüÊÄßÁöÑÂΩ±Âìç,Êú¨Á†îÁ©∂‰ª•ÊùâÊú®‰∫∫Â∑•ÊûóÂúüÂ£§‰∏∫ÂØπË±°,Âú®2018Âπ¥6Êúà‰∏ÄÊ¨°ÊÄßÊ∑ªÂä†0„ÄÅ1Âíå5 t¬∑hm-2ÁöÑÊ∞ßÂåñÈíô,‰∫é2020Âπ¥6ÊúàÂºÄÂßãËøõË°å‰∏∫Êúü‰∏ÄÂπ¥ÁöÑÂéü‰ΩçÂúüÂ£§ÂëºÂê∏ÈÄüÁéáËßÇÊµã„ÄÇÁªìÊûúË°®Êòé: ‰∏é‰∏çÊñΩÁü≥ÁÅ∞Áõ∏ÊØî,ÊñΩÁü≥ÁÅ∞ÊòæËëóÊèêÈ´ò‰∫ÜÂúüÂ£§pHÂÄºÂíå‰∫§Êç¢ÊÄßCa2+Âê´Èáè,‰∏çÂêåÁü≥ÁÅ∞ÊñΩÁî®Èáè‰πãÈó¥Êó†ÊòæËëóÂ∑ÆÂºÇ„ÄÇÊùâÊú®‰∫∫Â∑•ÊûóÂúüÂ£§ÂëºÂê∏ÂèäÂÖ∂ÁªÑÂàÜÂÖ∑ÊúâÊòéÊòæÁöÑÂ≠£ËäÇÂ∑ÆÂºÇ,Ë°®Áé∞‰∏∫Â§èÂ≠£ÊúÄÈ´ò,ÂÜ¨Â≠£ÊúÄ‰Ωé,ÊñΩÁü≥ÁÅ∞Êú™ÊòæËëóÊîπÂèòÂÖ∂Â≠£ËäÇÂä®ÊÄÅÁâπÂæÅ„ÄÇÊñΩÁü≥ÁÅ∞ÊòæËëóÈôç‰Ωé‰∫ÜÂúüÂ£§ÂºÇÂÖªÂëºÂê∏ÈÄüÁéá,ÊèêÈ´ò‰∫ÜËá™ÂÖªÂëºÂê∏ÈÄüÁéá,ÊúÄÁªàÂØºËá¥ÊñΩÁü≥ÁÅ∞ÂØπÂúüÂ£§ÂëºÂê∏Êó†ÊòæËëóÂΩ±Âìç„ÄÇÂúüÂ£§ÂëºÂê∏ÊúàÂä®ÊÄÅÂèòÂåñ‰∏éÊ∏©Â∫¶ÊúàÂä®ÊÄÅÂèòÂåñÂü∫Êú¨‰øùÊåÅ‰∏ÄËá¥,ÂúüÂ£§ÂëºÂê∏‰∏éÂúüÂ£§Ê∏©Â∫¶ÂëàÊòæËëóÁöÑÊåáÊï∞ÂÖ≥Á≥ª,ÊñΩÁü≥ÁÅ∞ÂêéÂúüÂ£§ÂëºÂê∏ÂèäËá™ÂÖªÂëºÂê∏ÁöÑÊ∏©Â∫¶ÊïèÊÑüÊÄß(Q10)Âëà‰∏äÂçáË∂ãÂäø,ÂúüÂ£§ÂºÇÂÖªÂëºÂê∏ÁöÑQ10Âëà‰∏ãÈôçË∂ãÂäø„ÄÇÁªº‰∏ä,ÊñΩÁü≥ÁÅ∞ÊèêÈ´ò‰∫ÜÊùâÊú®‰∫∫Â∑•ÊûóÂúüÂ£§Ëá™ÂÖªÂëºÂê∏,ÊòæËëóÈôç‰Ωé‰∫ÜÂúüÂ£§ÂºÇÂÖªÂëºÂê∏,ËøôÊúâÂà©‰∫éÊùâÊú®‰∫∫Â∑•ÊûóÂúüÂ£§Âõ∫Á¢≥„ÄÇ.",,tech|10,meth|00,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.81,0.07,0.03,0.03,0.08,0.05,0.91,0.03,0.02,0.02,0.04,0.04,0.01,0.98,0.03,0.02,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37236935,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Part 2: Mapping of soil ecosystem services,"The James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen, UK; The James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen, UK","A framework for estimating the distribution of soil ecosystem service ( ES ) supply is described that is based on the concept of matrix multiplication. This approach enables relationships between fundamental soil variables and associated environmental characteristics to be linked to soil processes, and hence to ecosystem functions and ecosystem services. The parameterization of these relationships was achieved using a combination of data from the Scottish Soils Database and expert knowledge. Baseline data to allow mapping of processes, functions and services across Scotland is given by digital maps of soil classes. The matrix multiplication approach constrains the relationship linkages to linear relationships and ignores potential synergies between factors at each stage, but does provide a mechanism for relating fundamental soil characteristics to ecosystem services. The approach has been tested by developing maps of selected ecosystem services in Scotland and comparing these with existing maps of the same or similar ES s. While the values and their ranges differ in each case, the spatial distribution of services is similar. The proposed mechanism is extensible at every level and can also be used to explore the impacts of land management options on environmental characteristics. This is demonstrated by using the model to estimate impacts of liming on three ecosystem services: Agricultural Capability, Carbon Sequestration and Drinking Water Provision. The model is shown to produce reasonable estimation of the impacts of this management option.

However, upland grasslands are sensitive to management decisions, and careful planning is needed to ensure that they continue to provide a range of ecosystem services. Using the long-term grassland experimental plots at Brignant, Wales, management and liming effects on soil organic carbon and related soil parameters under long-term permanent pastures were explored. Results showed that interactions between management and liming could significantly influence carbon storage potential, making a difference of up to 0.45 kg C m‚àí2 in Hay-cut swards. The greatest reductions were found under pastures that had been cut (rather than grazed) and limed, probably due to a combination of enhanced soil microbial activity, increased root production and a lack of fresh biomass.

An agronomic assessment of GHG emissions and environmental concerns related to potential contamination of heavy metals in the food chain have also been evaluated. Existing literatures documents a range of impacts that slag fertilization can be effective in increasing crop yield, mitigating GHG emissions, and decreasing yield-scaled global warming potential. Heavy metal accumulation in soil and their uptake by the plant are not consistent with the application of slag, mostly accumulated in roots, and very low translocation level in grains/fruits.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can enhance capture of C in artificial soils through production of glomalin‚Äêrelated soil protein (GRSP), which facilitates soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and aggregation, and may also enhance precipitation of soil inorganic carbon (SIC). In this paper, we show how different mixtures of dolerite and concrete affect AMF community structure and function, GRSP fractions, and soil organic and inorganic carbon contents. We used nine demonstration plots, 1 m deep, to simulate a constructed urban soil, consisting of different proportions (0, 30, 50, 70 and 100%) of either crushed concrete demolition waste or dolerite quarry fines and sown to a species‚Äêrich meadow mixture, to investigate AMF colonization and community structure (using DNA terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism), contents of easily‚Äêextractable and difficultly‚Äêextractable GRSP, and both organic and inorganic carbon contents. All artificial soils supported functioning AMF communities with different levels of GRSP, SIC and SOC. The 100% dolerite and 100% concrete soils had higher values of difficultly‚Äêto‚Äêextract GRSP andSOC than pure sand, whereas 100% concrete had higher AMF colonization and SOC than sand. AMF community analysis indicated that high GRSP producing species were abundant in 100% dolerite and 100% concrete. These findings demonstrate that there is potential to incorporate demolition waste or dolerite products into the land to support environmental sustainability and enhance soil C sequestration.

Longterm experiment was initially conducted in February 1987, at experiment farm of Politeknik Negeri Lampung, Sumatra, Indonesia. The soil is a Typic Fragiudult with slope ranging from 6 to 9%, located at 105Àö13‚ÄôE, 05Àö21‚ÄôS, with elevation 122 m. The experiment was a factorial, randomized complete block design, with 4 replications. Tillage treatments were conservation tillage (no-tillage, NT and minimum tillage, MT), and conventional tillage (CT); while nitrogen fertilization rates were 0, 100 and 200 kg N ha -1 . Cropping pattern of the long-term experiment was cereal-legume-fallow rotation. Due to soil compaction in 1997 and 2002, all plots of conservation tillage were plowed. After eleven years of cropping, the soil became acid, therefore; in 2004 all plots were limed with 4 Mg ha -1 of CaCO 3 . To determine the effect of long-term no-tillage and N fertilization on earthworm, the soil samples were collected at depth of 0-10 cm in 2001 and 2008; and for soil microbial biomass C and soil organic C, samples were taken at depth 0-20 cm in 2008 after 21 years of continuous experiment. The only treatment that affected earthworm population in both 14 th and 21 st year of cropping was tillage treatment. After 14 years of cropping (2001), NT had earthworms averaged of 101m -2 , 46% and 39% (p<0.05) higher than CT and MT, respectively. In 21 st year of cropping, however, the response showed a little change; NT had earthworm with averaged of 99 m -2 , 251% higher (p<0.05) than CT, but 40% lower than MT. In rhizosphere samples, MT had microbial biomass 228 mg C-CO 2 kg -1 day -1 , or 45.5% higher (p<0.05) than NT and 70.7% higher than CT; while 100 kg N ha -1 N treatment had 227 mg C-CO 2 kg -1 day -1 , 28% and 103% higher (p<0.05) than 0 and 200 kg N ha -1 treatments, respectively. After 21 years of cropping, soil organic carbon of MT in rhizosphere at 0-20 cm soil depth was 16.5 g kg -1 , or 9.3% and 13.0% higher (p<0.05) than NT and CT, respectively; but in non-rhizosphere was not signifi cantly (p<0.05) affected by any treatment.",,tech|04,meth|00,cont|5,0.02,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.91,0.05,0.03,0.02,0.03,0.02,0.69,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.98,0.02,0.01,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.99,,http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/120002444072,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Sustainable land management (SLM) practices can improve soil and enhance yields. This study identifies variations in SLM uptake, characterising farmers most likely to use SLM practices, identifying when it makes economic sense for farmers to implement particular SLM practices and how long it takes before benefits exceed costs. Using questionnaire data from farmers in western Kenya, we undertake a cost‚Äìbenefit analysis and analyse determinants of SLM practice use. SLM implementation varied between counties and SLM practice(s), with household and farm characteristics, and access to assets and advice, playing a key role. SLM practices with high upfront and maintenance costs (e.g., terraces and agroforestry) offer low benefit‚Äêto‚Äêcost ratios for individual farmers who must also wait many years to break even on their investments. Nevertheless, over the policy‚Äêrelevant time horizon considered (to 2030), Net present value can be positive. Simple SLM practices (manuring and intercropping) have low input costs and offer high benefit to cost ratios, providing a positive net present value up to 2030. Findings suggest that simple practices should be prioritised within policy to improve soil and increase yields. These should be supported by subsidies or other economic measures, facilitating uptake of practices such as agroforestry, which can provide wider societal benefits (e.g., improved water retention and carbon sequestration). Economic mechanisms could be augmented with support for agricultural innovation systems, improved monitoring of land management and yield relationships, and investment in climate and soil information services.",,tech|10,meth|03,cont|4,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.02,0.43,0.11,0.02,0.02,0.07,0.01,0.56,0.03,0.02,0.01,0.04,0.19,0.01,0.06,0.02,0.02,0.81,0.03,0.04,0.05,0.06,0.1,0.03,0.03,0.02,0.17,0.02,0.87,0.03,,https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3001,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

This study is important because sequestering carbon (C) in soil is a key component of the Australian government‚Äôs Direct Action Policy to offset the nation‚Äôs greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The biophysical potential for sequestering C using one of four permitted project management activities (new irrigation, managing soil acidity, stubble retention and converting cropland to permanent pasture) was calculated according to the Methodology Determination - Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Estimating Sequestration of Carbon in Soil Using Default Values, 2015. The economic prospects of those activities that show a net C abatement were then evaluated to determine whether they were profitable for a farmer to implement. Finally, the costs and benefits from society‚Äôs perspective of those activities found to be profitable were calculated. Of these activities only stubble retention and liming provided net benefits to a farmer, although there were limitations as to how widely these activities could be implemented nationally. We estimated a cost to government of approximately $35 M annually to achieve a net abatement of 2.84 M t CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-e. Because this represents only 0.52 percent of Australia‚Äôs annual GHG emissions of 549 M t CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-e, the policy is both expensive and relatively ineffective as a C offset policy alone.

The objectives of this study were to use the RothC model to simulate soil carbon sequestration and determine the proportion of pasture production as carbon input for SOC sequestration under different pasture types and pasture management in a long term experiment established in 1992. There were two types of pastures, annual and perennial pastures, with or without application of limestone. Simulation results showed that with an initial setting for the stubble retention factor of 0.65 and root/shoot ratio of 0.5 for annual pasture and 1.0 for perennial pasture, RothC can adequately simulate SOC for both pasture types, especially annual pasture. Using an inverse modelling technique, the root/shoot ratio was determined as 0.49 and 0.57 for annual pasture and 0.72 and 0.76 for perennial pasture with and without limestone application, respectively. There was a large improvement in model performance for perennial pasture with and without limestone application. The root mean squared errors (RMSE) reduced from 3.19 and 2.99 t C ha‚àí1 in the initial settings to 2.09 and 2.10 t C ha‚àí1, while performance efficiency (PE) increased from 0.89 and 0.91 to the same value of 0.95 when the root/shoot ratio of 0.72 and 0.76 were used for limed and unlimed perennial pastures. However, there was little improvement for annual pasture as RMSE had little change and PE was the same.

Russell,Nanobiotechnology for enzymatic remediation and soil carbon sequestration,,"We studied the ability of tyrosinase to catalyze the oxidation of various phenolic compounds. As a revolutionary approach to enzyme stabilization, we developed specially-designed nanoporous silica for enzyme immobilization. Our tests show that the active lifetime of the enzymes stabilized in this material can extend to periods as long as several months, which is about a 100-fold increase in stability. The implications of this new approach to enzyme-based bioremedation will be discussed. In soils, the humification process involves phenol oxidation, mediated by tyrosinase, followed by nonenzymatic polymerization of the resulting quinones with amino acids to form humic polymers. We tested the effects of fly ash amendments on a model humification reaction involving tyrosinase and a suite of organic monomers. The combination of fly ashes with tyrosinase increased the amount of polymer formed by several fold. The strong synergetic effect of these ashes when enzyme is present apparently arises from the combined effects of alkaline pH and physical stabilization of the enzyme in porous silica cenospheres.",,tech|04,meth|01,cont|5,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.78,0.02,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.38,0.57,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.99,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/985085,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

However, unintended biogeochemical interactions with the nitrogen cycle may arise through ERW increasing soil pH as basalt grains undergo dissolution that may reinforce, counteract, or even offset the climate benefits from carbon sequestration. Increases in soil pH could drive changes in the soil emissions of key non-CO2 greenhouse gases, e.g., nitrous oxide (N2O), and trace gases, e.g., nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3) that affect air quality, and crop and human health. We present the development and implementation of a new improved nitrogen cycling scheme for the land surface model Community Land Model v5 (CLM5), the land component of the Community Earth System Model, allowing evaluation of ERW effects on soil gas emissions.
